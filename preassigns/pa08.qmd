title: "{{< var course.short >}} Week 8 Pre Assignment: More Plots"
---

This week, we will dive deeper into the world of `ggplot2`, with a focus
on spatial data visualization and interactive graphics. Before we do so, 
let's pause and consolidate everything we've done to date. 

1. If you did not finish [last week's in-class lab](../labs/lab07.html), 
   do so now.

2. Watch [Prof. Di Cook](https://www.dicook.org/)'s lecture "Myth busting and  
   apophenia in data visualisation: is what you see really there?". As we 
   discussed in class, plots are an excellent way to explore data, but we
   always want to be careful that what we think find truly exists. Prof. Cook
   discusses relationships between effective statistical visualization and 
   effective statistical practice.
