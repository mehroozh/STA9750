## Introduction

Welcome to Mini-Project #02. In this project, you will play the role of a Hollywood development executive; that is, you are the executive in charge of coming up with new movie ideas. Historically, development executives would source the "life rights" necessary to make "based on a true story" movies, would secure production options on promising new novels, and would partner with owners of established intellectual property (IP) to develop movie adaptations. Recently, however, the development process has been criticized by Hollywood insiders and audiences alike for over-reliance on rote sequels. Our goal is to develop a set of data-driven ideas for new movies. Before doing so, however, we will dive into Hollywood history to identify key characteristics of successful movies, to identify successful filmmakers and actors, and to examine some of Hollywood's most famous flops.

### Student Responsbilities

Recall our basic analytic workflow and table of student responsibilities:

-   Data Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into `R` and transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.
-   Data Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable insights not possible from a single source.
-   Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups
-   Data Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights not attainable from point statistics
-   Inferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the *underlying population* and not simply the data at hand.

: Students' Responsibilities in Mini-Project Analyses {.hover}

In this mini-project, you are mainly responsible for data alignment and basic statistical analyses. While not the main focus of this mini-project, you are also expected to provide basic data visualizations to support your findings; the grading rubric, below, emphasizes the `dplyr` tools used in this project, but reports without any visualization will be penalized severely. Note that data visualization will play a larger role in Mini-Project #03.

As before, I will provide code to automatically download and read in the data used for this project. Also note that, as compared with Mini-Project #01, I am providing significantly less 'scaffolding': students are more responsible for directing their own analyses.

### Rubric

{{< var course.short >}} Mini-Projects are evaluated using *peer grading* with
*meta-review* by the course GTAs. Specifically, variants of the following rubric
will be used for the mini-projects:

: Mini-Project Grading Rubric

Note that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if students go *above and beyond* the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more impressive professional portfolio.

Because students are encouraged to use {{< var course.short >}} mini-projects as
the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be
released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!

### Submission Instructions

After completing the analysis, write up your findings, *showing all of your code*, using a dynamic `quarto` document and post it to your course repository. The `qmd` file should be named `mp02.qmd` so the rendered document can be found at `docs/mp02.html` in the student's repository and served at the URL:

> `https://<GITHUB_ID>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp01.html`

Once you confirm this website works (substituting `<GITHUB_ID>` for the actual
GitHub username provided to the professor in [MP#00](./mini00.html) of course),
open a new issue at

> `https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/{{< var course.repo >}}/issues/new` .

Title the issue `{{< var course.short >}} <GITHUB_USERNAME> MiniProject #02` 
and fill in the following text for the issue:

```         
Hi @michaelweylandt!

I've uploaded my work for MiniProject #02 - check it out!

https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/{{< var course.repo >}}/mp02.html
```

Once the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for peer feedback in this issue thread.

*Additionally*, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace. To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser's 'Print to PDF' functionality.

**NB**: The analysis outline below specifies key *tasks* you need to perform within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded **Tasks** are *mandatory*.

**NB**: Your final submission should look like a *report*, not simply a list of facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own commentary. You should be practicing both raw *coding* skills and written *communication* in all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated without context or motivation.

## Mini-Project #02

### Data

For this project, we will use data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Specifically, we will use the tables from [the IMDb
non-commercial release](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). These files
are made freely available by IMDb for non-commercial use. 

The following code will automatically download and load these files
into `R`: 

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_name_basics'
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: true
get_imdb_file <- function(fname){
    BASE_URL <- "https://datasets.imdbws.com/"
    fname_ext <- paste0(fname, ".tsv.gz")
    if(!file.exists(fname_ext)){
        FILE_URL <- paste0(BASE_URL, fname_ext)
        download.file(FILE_URL, 
                      destfile = fname_ext)
    }
    as.data.frame(readr::read_tsv(fname_ext, lazy=FALSE))
}

NAME_BASICS      <- get_imdb_file("name.basics")
```

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_title_basics'
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: true
TITLE_BASICS     <- get_imdb_file("title.basics")
```

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_title_episode'
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: true
TITLE_EPISODES   <- get_imdb_file("title.episode")
```

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_title_ratings'
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: true
TITLE_RATINGS    <- get_imdb_file("title.ratings")
```

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_title_crew'
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: true
TITLE_CREW       <- get_imdb_file("title.crew")
```

```{r}
#| label: 'imdb_title_principals'
#| eval: false
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| cache: false
TITLE_PRINCIPALS <- get_imdb_file("title.principals")
``` 

Note that these are **large** files and it will take some time for
them to download the first time. Because these files are so large,
it will also take a little while to read them. If you want to speed
up this stage, you can
[cache](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/caching.html#knitr-cache) 
the code chunk that reads the files. This will 'save' the result of the chunk
and only require it to be re-executed when it is changed. 

### Data Sub-Sampling

This data is large enough that we're going to need to immediately 
start down-selecting to get to a data set that we can analyze fluidly. For
our `NAME_BASICS` table, we'll restrict our attention to people with at 
least two "known for" credits.[^1]

```{r}
#| label: 'name_basics_filter'
#| cache: true
NAME_BASICS <- NAME_BASICS |> 
    filter(str_count(knownForTitles, ",") > 1)
```

IMDb has a _long_ tail of obscure movies: 

```{r}
#| label: 'title_ratings_tail'
TITLE_RATINGS |>
    ggplot(aes(x=numVotes)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins=30) +
    xlab("Number of IMDB Ratings") + 
    ylab("Number of Titles") + 
    ggtitle("Majority of IMDB Titles Have Less than 100 Ratings") + 
    theme_bw() + 
    scale_x_log10(label=scales::comma) + 
    scale_y_continuous(label=scales::comma)
```

To keep our computers from working too hard, let's throw out any title
with less than 100 ratings. It's not too hard to see that this drops
about 75% of the entire data set: 

```{r}
#| label: 'title_ratings_quantile'
TITLE_RATINGS |>
    pull(numVotes) |>
    quantile()
```

Applying this drop, we significantly reduce the size of our data set:

```{r}
#| label: 'title_ratings_filter'
#| cache: true
TITLE_RATINGS <- TITLE_RATINGS |>
    filter(numVotes >= 100)
```

We want to perform the same filtering on our other `TITLE_*` tables.
This is a rare use for the [`semi_join`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html).
Recall that a `semi_join` returns only values which have a match,but
doesn't actually add columns. 

```{r}
#| cache: true
#| label: 'title_other_filter'
#| message: false
TITLE_BASICS <- TITLE_BASICS |>
    semi_join(TITLE_RATINGS, 
              join_by(tconst == tconst))

TITLE_CREW <- TITLE_CREW |>
    semi_join(TITLE_RATINGS, 
              join_by(tconst == tconst))

TITLE_EPISODES_1 <- TITLE_EPISODES |>
    semi_join(TITLE_RATINGS, 
              join_by(tconst == tconst))
TITLE_EPISODES_2 <- TITLE_EPISODES |>
    semi_join(TITLE_RATINGS, 
              join_by(parentTconst == tconst))

TITLE_EPISODES <- bind_rows(TITLE_EPISODES_1,
                            TITLE_EPISODES_2) |>
    distinct()

TITLE_PRINCIPALS <- TITLE_PRINCIPALS |>
    semi_join(TITLE_RATINGS, join_by(tconst == tconst))


rm(TITLE_EPISODES_1)
rm(TITLE_EPISODES_2)
```

At this point, we've filtered down our data _significantly_ and are ready
to begin analysis in earnest. Note that our sub-sampling may induce some
'dangling' references: some of the people dropped from the `NAME_BASICS`
table may only appear in one famous movie, and we've likely lost their
info. 

::: {.callout-warning}
#### Processing Large Data

Even with this processing, this a non-trivial amount of data, requiring
approximately 2 GB of memory. If your computer is significantly
struggling to perform this pre-processing, the instructor may be able to
provide smaller data files upon request. (Even on my quite modern laptop,
the initial processing phase takes a few minutes: by 'significant struggling', I'm referring to processing taking upwards of half an hour
or exhausting all available memory.) Please contact the instructor
and TA through the course discussion board to discuss this possibility.

Processing large data sets is a skill, however, so we're starting with
the large data set to help you practice it.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Pre-Processed Data" collapse=true}
Exports of the pre-processed data can be found on [the course GitHub
repo](https://github.com/michaelweylandt/STA9750/tree/main/miniprojects/mini02_preprocessed/).
If your computer is struggling to handle the full data set, you may
choose to use these instead. The `readr::read_csv` files handles zip
compression transparently.
:::

### Initial Exploration

At this point, let's start examining our data more closely. Use the
`glimpse` function to examine each table, taking care to note the _type_
or _mode_ of each column. For this data set, most columns appear to be
read in as _character_ (string) vectors, even when they should be
numeric. This can occur when "null" values are represented in some
non-standard way. For instance, in these files, we see that missing
values are represented as `\\N`. `R` does not know that these are `NA`
values and so retains them as strings.[^2]

To fix this, we need to use: 

1. the `mutate` command, since we're changing the type of a column
2. the `as.numeric` command to change the type of the column.

We can clean the `NAMES_BASIC` command as follows: 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
NAME_BASICS <- NAME_BASICS |>
    mutate(birthYear = as.numeric(birthYear),
           deathYear = as.numeric(deathYear))
```

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 1: Column Type Correction

Correct the column types of the `TITLE` tables using a combination
of `mutate` and the coercion functions `as.numeric` and `as.logical`.
:::

Another non-tidy aspect of this data is that it combines multiple pieces
of information in a single cell separated by commas. We already saw a bit
of this in the `NAME_BASICS` table, where both the `primaryProfession` and
`knownForTitles` columns combine multiple values. 

```{r}
glimpse(NAME_BASICS)
```

We can use the `separate_longer_delim` function to break these into multiple
rows: for example

```{r}
#| label: 'seaprate_longer_delim_example'
#| cache: true
NAME_BASICS |> separate_longer_delim(knownForTitles, ",") |> slice_head(n=10)
```

To preserve flexibility, let's not fully separate `NAME_BASICS` just yet, but
you will need to use `separate_longer_delim` to answer various questions. 

Using your knowledge of `dplyr` functionality, answer the following questions


::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 2: Instructor-Provided Questions

1. How many movies are in our data set? How many TV series? How many TV episodes?
2. Who is the oldest living person in our data set? 
3. There is one TV Episode in this data set with a perfect 10/10 rating and 200,000 IMDb ratings. What is it? What series does it belong to?
4. What four projects is the actor Mark Hammill most known for? 
5. What TV series, with more than 12 episodes, has the highest _average_
   rating? 
6. The TV series *Happy Days* (1974-1984) gives us the common idiom ["jump the
   shark"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark). The phrase comes
   from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead
   character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it
   is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and
   rapidly looses quality. 
   
   Is it true that episodes from later seasons of *Happy Days* have lower
   average ratings than the early seasons?

*Hint:* It may be useful to create a "map" of which columns map to which tables
before attempting these questions. While these can be [quite
formal](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sql+schema+map&iax=images&ia=images), even 
some basic sketches on a scratch piece of paper are often quite clarifying.
:::

### Quantifying Success

Our goal is to proposal successful new movies. To do so, we need
a way of measuring the success of a movie given only IMDb ratings.[^3] While
there's no "magic number" for success, it is logical to assume that a
successful project will have both a high average IMDb rating, indicating
quality, and a large number of ratings, indicating broad awareness in the
public. 

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 3: Custom Success Metric

Design a 'success' measure for IMDb entries, reflecting both quality and
broad popular awareness. Implement your success metric using a `mutate`
operator to add a new column to the `TITLE_RATINGS` table. 

Validate your success metric as follows: 

1. Choose the top 5-10 movies on your metric and confirm that they were
   indeed box office successes.
2. Choose 3-5 movies with large numbers of IMDb votes that score poorly
   on your success metric and confirm that they are indeed of low quality.
3. Choose a prestige actor or director and confirm that they have many projects
   with high scores on your success metric.
4. Perform at least one other form of 'spot check' validation. 
5. Come up with a numerical threshold for a project to be a 'success'; that is,
   determine a value $v$ such that movies above $v$ are all "solid" or better.
:::

You will use your success metric and threshold to complete the rest of this
Mini-Project. You may, if you wish, restrict your attention to movies for the
remainder of your analysis, though a good development executive should also
consider making TV series. 

### Examining Success by Genre and Decade

Now that you have a working proxy for success, it's time to look at trends in
success over time. Answer the following questions. Your responses should
include at least 2 graphics.

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 4: Trends in Success Over Time
Using questions like the following, identify a good "genre" for your next 
film. You do not need to answer these questions precisely, but these are
may help guide your thinking. 

1. What was the genre with the most "successes" in each decade? 
2. What genre consistently has the most "successes"? What genre used to reliably produced "successes" and has fallen out of favor? 
3. What genre has produced the most "successes" since 2010? Does it have the
   highest success _rate_ or does it only have a large number of successes
   because there are many productions in that genre? 
4. What genre has become more popular in recent years? 
:::

Based on your findings, select a genre for your next project. Note that you may
wish to avoid an "oversatured" genre; you just need to make the argument that
your proposal is a _good_ investment, not necessarily the most _studio-produced
focus-grouped committee-designed generic satisfying_ choice, so feel free to
lean in to your own artistic preferences, as long as you can make an argument
for them.

### Successful Personnel in the Genre

Now that you have selected a target genre, identify two actors and one director
who will anchor your project. You want to identify key personnel who have
worked in the genre before, with at least modest success, and who have at least
one major success to their credit.

As you develop your team, you may want to consider the
following possibilities: 

- An older established actor and an up-and-coming actor
- An actor/director pair who have been successful together
- An actor/director pair who are both highly successful but have never worked
  together
- A pair of established actors who have had success in many genres

As you select your key personnel, consider what IMDb says they are known for;
this will be useful in developing your marketing materials. 

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 5: Key Personnel

Identify (at least) two actors and one director who you will target as
the key talent for your movie. Write a short "pitch" as to why they are
likely to be successful. You should support your pitch with at least one
graphic and one table.
:::

### Nostalgia and Remakes

Now that you have found a target genre and key talent for your project, you
need a story. Like any good development executive, your first instinct should
be to produce a remake of a classic film in the genre. 

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 6: Finding a Classic Movie to Remake

Find a classic movie to remake with your key talent. The original should have
a large number of IMDb ratings, a high average rating, and not have been remade
in the past 25 years.[^4] 

Once you have found your classic movie to remake, confirm whether key actors,
directors, or writers from the original are still alive. If so, you need to 
contact your legal department to ensure they can secure the rights to the 
project. You may also want to include the classic actors as "fan service."
:::

## Putting It Together

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Task 7: Write and Deliver Your Pitch

Now that you have completed your analysis, write an "elevator pitch" of 
approximately 200-250 words for your proposed Hollywood project. This is the
pitch you will bring to the studio head (your boss); if the studio head likes
your pitch, you will be given a small sum of money to start securing the story
rights and locking down tentative deals with key talent. 

Your pitch needs to synthesize the analysis above into two to three quick
and compelling points. (*E.g.*, "The market for animated young adult horror
musicals has grown 200% in the past decade" or "Over 90% of Director D's movies
are successes.") You need to present the strongest argument for each element
of your pitch, including genre, director, actors, and story. 

If your boss approves the pitch, you will need to have a brief trailer ready
for the next quarterly earnings call. The marketing department has asked that
you prepare a classic 90's style teaser for them. Adapt the following
cliched formula for your pitch. 

> From director D, the visionary mind between N1; and
> From actor A, beloved star of N2; and
> From actor A2, Hollywood icon of genre G,
> Comes the timeless tail N3
> A story of TOPIC, TOPIC, and TOPIC
> Coming soon to a theater near you. 

If you're creatively-minded, you could have some fun here using
Generative tools to draft a script or mock up a movie poster for your
pitch.

:::

## General Remarks

As you approach this project, recall there are no right or wrong answers. You
are exploring data looking for _exciting_ and _actionable_ findings. You have
several key decisions to make and you can support them with data, but the
decisions are ultimately yours. This project is an exercise both in
the "nuts-and-bolts" of analyzing a large data set and in using data to inform
and refine what is ultimately still a "gut feeling" qualitative business
decision. 

As you iterate on this project, you will see that seemingly small different
choices can produce very different results. That's ok! As data analysts, we
are constantly faced with small and essentially arbitrary decisions. An 
important "meta-skill" is knowing which of these decisions radically
change our findings and which are meaningless. (An arbitrary decision
with no impact on the bottom line is harmless; an arbitrary decision
that could entirely change the plan for the next ten years is a problem.)
Our responsibility is to _clearly_ communicate these choices to our partners
and clients: then we can receive their feedback on which way they would like
to proceed. 

Working in tools like `Quarto` and `R` helps here: if
we provide clean and reproducible code, it should be easy to modify to see
how our final conclusions are changed. Graphics also play an essential role
in this form of clear communication: a 'point estimate' like "Action A is
the best" is far less interpretable than a chart showing the predicted outcomes
of several different actions. 

As you approach this project, focus on justifying and communicating the choices
you make. Structure your argument to communicate both key findings and uncertainties around them. Think about how you can use both document structure
(headings vs subsections) and graphics to communicate with both clarity and nuance. 

Good luck!

[^1]: It's not entirely transparent who IMDb decides what projects an actor
or director is "known for". Still, it's a reasonable filter that leaves us
with more than enough to work with for this project. 

[^2]: Recall that _strings_ can contain essentially any data type and so
are a safe fall-back. For instance, a column containing `1` and `a` can
be losslessly represented by the string vector `c("1", "a")` but coercion
to the numeric vector `c(1, NA)` is lossy. `R` tries very hard not to
destroy any information and so it doesn't perform this conversion for us
unless we explicitly request it.

[^3]: Sadly, I couldn't find permissively licensed movie box office data. If
you are aware of some, please let me know!

[^4]: In order to see that a movie has not been recently remade, it is
sufficient to confirm that no movie has been made with the same name in the 
past 25 years.
