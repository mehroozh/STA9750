# Vector Semantics in `R`

`R` works with _3_ core principal structures: 

- Vectors: an ordered (one-dimensional) collection _of the same type_
  - Numeric (real number / double), Integer, Character, Logical (Boolean)
  - Scalars (single values) are just vectors of length 1
- Lists: an ordered collection of arbitrary objects (other vectors, other lists, *etc*)
- Data Frames: ordered tabular database (think SQL tables)
  - Next week, we'll discuss these in detail
  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
