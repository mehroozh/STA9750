Welcome to the course website for STA/OPR 9750 (Fall 2024)!

STA/OPR 9750 is an _Introduction to R_ targeted at students in the [MS in Business Analytics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/masters-in-business-analytics/), [MS in Statistics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/), and [MS in Quantitative Methods](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/quantitative-methods-modeling/) programs. Though listed as a double course, STA9750 and OPR9750 will be taught and graded jointly: students are encouraged to collaborate with classmates in either section.

This site hosts the unofficial [Course Syllabus](./syllabus.html), 
[Course Policies](./resources.html), and [Course Learning Objectives](./objectives.html).
Official copies of these documents can be found on [CUNY Brightspace](https://brightspace.cuny.edu).
Course [pre-assignments](./preassigns.html), [labs](./labs.html), and 
[mini-projects](./miniprojects.html) can also be found on this site.

This year, STA9750 will be taught in a mixture of the *flipped-classroom* and 
*experiential-learning* formats. Roughly, this means that most weeks, students will
be asked to complete a small [_pre-assignment_](./preassignments.html) each week
to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week's lecture. Each class period will
be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more detail and an extended 
[_lab activity_](./labs.html) designed to build familiarity and fluency with that week's
subject matter. 

There are quite a few moving parts to this course, so this [key dates file](./key_dates.csv)
or the list of upcoming course activities below may be useful:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("key_dates.csv") |> 
    dplyr::arrange(Date) |> 
    DT::datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE,
                               paging=TRUE),
                  caption="Upcoming Important Dates for STA/OPR 9750")
```

<script defer>
window.addEventListener("load", function(){
  var filter_date = new Date();
  filter_date.setDate(filter_date.getDate() - 1);
  var filter_string = filter_date.toISOString().split('T')[0]
  $("table").DataTable().rows((idx, data) => data[5] < filter_string).remove().draw();
});
</script>

can be found [here](./key_dates_students_gcal.csv).
