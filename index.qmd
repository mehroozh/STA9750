Welcome to the course website for STA/OPR 9750 (Fall 2024)!

STA/OPR 9750 is an _Introduction to R_ targeted at students in the [MS in Business Analytics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/masters-in-business-analytics/), [MS in Statistics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/), and [MS in Quantitative Methods](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/quantitative-methods-modeling/) programs. Though listed as a double course, STA9750 and OPR9750 will be taught and graded jointly: students are encouraged to collaborate with classmates in either section. 

This year, STA9750 will be taught in a mixture of the *flipped-classroom* and 
*experiential-learning* formats. Roughly, this means that most weeks, students will
be asked to complete a small [_pre-assignment_](./preassignments.html) each week
to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week's lecture. Each class period will
be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more detail and an extended 
[_lab activity_](./labs.html) designed to build familiarity and fluency with that week's
subject matter.
