    "title": "STA/OPR 9750 - Course Policies & Additional Resources",
    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAcademic Integrity Policy\nI fully support CUNY’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, in part:\n\nAcademic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for academic dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion.\n\n\nAcademic integrity is at the core of a college or university education. Faculty assign essays, exams, quizzes, projects, and so on both to extend the learning done in the classroom and as a means of assessing that learning. When students violate the academic integrity policy (i.e., “cheat”), they are committing an act of theft that can cause real harm to themselves and others including, but not limited to, their classmates, their faculty, and the caregivers who may be funding their education. Academic dishonesty confers an unfair advantage over others, which undermines educational equity and fairness. Students who cheat place their college’s accreditation and their own future prospects in jeopardy.\n\nAcademic sanctions in this class will range from an F on the Assignment to an F in this Course. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students.\nStudents are encouraged to contact the instructor with any questions or concerns related to matters of academic integrity.\n\n\nExternal Resources Use Policy\nFor the coding elements of this course, students are encouraged to use freely available online resources, including question-and-answer fora such as StackOverflow. You may also use AI-driven developer tools such as GitHub Co-Pilot. Paid services are not allowed. On each assignment, you will be asked to list external resources used on each assignment. You are ultimately responsible for the correctness of any submitted materials - ``the AI told me so’’ is not a valid defense.\nNote on ChatGPT and Related Large-Language Models: You may not use large-language models to complete any assignment in this course. Specifically, you may not use tools where you describe the course assignment in natural language and receive (pseudo-)code output. While these tools are powerful, and often surprisingly accurate, for this task, using them in this manner will undermine the learning objectives of this course.\nFor the written elements of this course (e.g. Project Final Report), standard academic expectations of attribution and citation are in place. This will be covered in more detail in the course project documents.\nStudents are highly encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but each student is required to individually and complete each assignment. If substantially identical assignments are submitted, the instructor may require each student to individually demonstrate their understanding of the material. Collaborators should be listed at the end of each submitted assignment along with a statement of contributions.\n\n\nUnexcused Abscence Policy\nAttendance is not required, but lecture recordings will not be provided. Students are responsible for the content of all sessions missed.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nLate work will not be accepted except in extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances. Students submitting late work should provide supporting documentation to the Office of the Dean of Students; ODS will provide the instructor with a letter authorizing late work submission as appropriate.\nAll assignment submission technology used in this course allows multiple submissions, so students are encouraged to submit early and often to avoid any technology troubles associated with late submission.\nNote that late work is allowed consistent with specific pre-arranged course accomodations as noted below."

SDS can be reached by email at disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu, by phone at 646-312-4590, or in person at NVC 2-272.\nPlease note that the instructor cannot provide accommodations unless requested by SDS.\n\n\nReligious Accomodations\nIt is CUNY policy to provide accommodations for students’ sincerely held religious beliefs. If a religious accommodation is requested, please contact the instructor at least two weeks in advance."

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\nThis course is intended to be demanding, but not difficult. If you feel like you are struggling, please reach out sooner rather than later. Swimming long-distances in choppy waters builds strength: drowning doesn’t.\n\nMental Health Resources\nIf you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.\nThe Baruch Counselling Center is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor or call them at 646-312-2155 during normal business hours; you can make an appointment online here. For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL (1-888-NYC-WELL or 1-888-692-9355).\nAsking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help.\nIf you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the Baruch Campus Intervention Team.\n\n\nPhysical Health\nHealthy CUNY promotes well-being and a culture of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students. They can connect you with a variety of campus- and community-based healthcare providers.\nBaruch Health Services provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call 646-312-2040 or email StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu to make an appointment.\n\n\nFood Security\nAll CUNY students have access to CUNY Food Pantries located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the CUNY CARES program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with SNAP (“Food Stamps”) enrollment.\n\n\nImmigration Status\nCUNY Citizenship Now! provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students.\nNote that Citizenship Now!’s primary Manhattan office is located in the Heights, not on the Baruch campus and that an appointment is strongly recommended. Call 646-664-9350 during standard business hours for more information or to make an appointment"

You can always hit Show Solution to get the correct answer. The feedback engine is a bit overly picky at times, so if your answer is substantially similar to the official solution, I wouldn’t worry too much.\nYou will see the R output sometimes has a [1] before it.

R implements all the basic operations of arithmetic:\n\na + b: (binary) addition \\(a + b\\)\na - b: (binary) subtraction \\(a - b\\)\n*: (binary) multiplication \\(ab\\)\n/: (binary) division \\(a/b\\)\n-b: (unary) negation \\(-b\\)\n\nYou can type integers and decimals in the usual manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute \\(5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\\) using R:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blanks should be filled with 3 and 1\n\n\n5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExponentials (powers) can be implemented with either a double star ** or a carrot ^:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tend to prefer the carrot ^ as its one fewer character.\nIn general, R respects the standard “PEMDAS” order of operations:\n\nParentheses\nExponentiation\nMultiplication and Division\nAddition and Subtraction\n\nSo we can compute \\(3 * (2 + 1)\\) as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nCompute the following algebraic expressions using R:\n\n\\[3 * 2^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 * 2^2\n3 * 2^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[(3 * 2)^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 * 2)^2\n(3 * 2)^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[3 + 2 - 1 + 4\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 + 2 - 1 + 4\n3 + 2 - 1 + 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[3 + 2 - (1 + 4)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 + 2 - (1 + 4)\n3 + 2 - (1 + 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecution in RStudio\nNow, redo these exercises in the RStudio Console. At each step, type the relevant code next to the &gt; prompt and hit enter to execute the command.\nR has greedy execution. When you hit enter, R tries its best to execute the whole line of code. If you enter an incomplete line of code, e.g., 3 +, R will change the &gt; prompt to a + prompt, indicating there is more to be done.\nCompare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first example, 3- is not a complete mathematical statement, so R knew there had to be more code and continued to await input. In the second, 3 is a perfectly valid (if very simple) mathematical command on its own, so R simply executes it as is.\nContinuation prompts from dangling math are quite rare, but you will often find yourself in this scenario if you let parentheses become mismatched. If you are ever stuck and can’t figure out how to appease R, simply type Cntrl-C to “interrupt” the command and get back to the standard prompt."

    "section": "Vectorized Semantics",
    "text": "Vectorized Semantics\nA distinguishing feature of R is its vectorized semantics. By default, R wants to operate on collections of data - not individual values (scalars). You’ve seen some evidence of this already. Whenever you run a bit of math, R puts [1] at the front of the output. This is R helping you count the number of elements in the solution; it’s been pretty trivial so far, as all our calculations have returned a single number. But this is about to change!\nThe easiest vectors to create in R are sequences: e.g., the list of numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, our output is a vector of 10 elements. R still tells us where the vector starts (at the first element) but nothing else. Change this code to create the first 100 elements and read R’s output. Do you understand the output?\nWhen R starts a new line of output, it tells you where you are in the vector. In RStudio, type letters to see the built-in vector of letters; this is a nice example of how the position information can be helpful in sorting through printed output.\nBy default, R operates on vectors elementwise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the sqrt function is applied to each element separately.\nWhen two vectors are combined, the operation also works elementwise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note that the sequence operator (:) has higher precedence than most arithmetic so this does “what you’d expect.”)\nThings get weird if the two vectors are of different lenghts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, R “recycles” 3 to be a vector of length 5 and then operators elementwise. That is, R computes\n\n3 + 1\n3 + 2\n3 + 3\n3 + 4\n3 + 5\n\nand combines the results.\nThis in general gives useful results, but the results can be quite alarming if combining vectors of unaligned size:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, R gives a warning that something weird happened. (This might seem annoying, but warnings are great! They help you find likely errors before anything too bad happens. Most experienced programmers wish R had more built-in warnings.)\nIt’s worth distinguishing warnings from errors. Errors occur when R absolutely cannot and will not execute your command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, it is impossible to add the number 3 to a letter, so R throws an error.\nWarnings are hints of possible problems, but do not prevent execution. When dealing with external software and packages, you will often get warnings about old versions of software. These are encouraging you to update, but unless you see an error, things probably worked out ok.\nSome of R’s built-in functions can be used to “summarize” a vector down to a single scalar (or, more precisely, a length 1 vector). These include sum, max, min, and mean. For example, we can compute the sum of the first 100 numbers as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApocryphally, a young C.F. Gauss did this calculation in his head to the great surprise of his school teacher. We might not have Gauss’s skills at arithmetic, but we can do quite a lot with R.\nFor example, the famous “Bessel problem” of mathematics is to compute\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\dots\\]\nEuler showed, somewhat remarkably, that the answer is \\(\\pi^2 / 6\\). We won’t repeat Euler’s analysis here, but let’s confirm it using R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good alignment!\nDo you understand everything that happened here? If so, you’re ready for next week’s class. Go ahead and fill out this week’s Brightspace quiz."

    "text": "Welcome to STA/OPR 9750 Mini Projects!\nIn the STA/OPR 9750 Mini-Projects, you will perform basic data analyses intended to model best practices for your course final project. (Note, however, that these are mini-projects; your final course project is expected to be far more extensive than any single MP.)\nFor purposes of MPs, we are dividing the basic data analytic workflow into several major stages:\n\nData Ingest and Cleaning: Given a single data source, read it into R and transform it to a reasonably useful standardized format.\nData Combination and Alignment: Combine multiple data sources to enable insights not possible from a single source.\nDescriptive Statistical Analysis: Take a data table and compute informative summary statistics from both the entire population and relevant subgroups\nData Visualization: Generate insightful data visualizations to spur insights not attainable from point statistics\nInferential Statistical Analysis and Modeling: Develop relevant predictive models and statistical analyses to generate insights about the underlying population and not simple the data at hand.\n\nIn this course, our primary focus is on the first four stages: you will take other courses that develop analytical and modeling techniques for a variety of data types. As we progress through the course, you will eventually be responsible for the first four steps. Specifically, you are responsible for the following stages of each mini-project:\n\nStudents’ Responsibilities in Mini-Project Analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngest and Cleaning\nCombination and Alignment\nDescriptive Statistical Analysis\nVisualization\n\n\n\nMini-Project #01\n\n\n✓\n\n\n\nMini-Project #02\n\n✓\n✓\n\n\n\nMini-Project #03\n\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nMini-Project #04\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\n\nIn early stages of the course, such as this MP, I will ‘scaffold’ much of the analysis for you, leaving only those stages we have discussed in class for you to fill in. As the course progresses, the mini-projects will be more self-directed and results less standardized.\nRubric\nSTA/OPR 9750 Mini-Projects are evaluated using peer grading with meta-review by the course GTAs. Specifically, variants of the following rubric will be used for the mini-projects:\n\nMini-Project Grading Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Element\nExcellent (9-10)\nGreat (7-8)\nGood (5-6)\nAdequate (3-4)\nNeeds Improvement (1-2)\nExtra Credit\n\n\n\nWritten Communication\nReport is well-written and flows naturally. Motivation for key steps is clearly explained to reader without excessive detail. Key findings are highlighted and appropriately given context.\nReport has no grammatical or writing issues. Writing is accessible and flows naturally. Key findings are highlighted, but lack suitable motivation and context.\nReport has no grammatical or writing issues. Key findings are present but insufficiently highlighted.\nWriting is intelligible, but has some grammatical errors. Key findings are obscured.\nReport exhibits significant weakness in written communication. Key points are difficult to discern.\nReport includes extra context beyond instructor provided information.\n\n\nProject Skeleton\nCode completes all instructor-provided tasks correctly\nResponse to one instructor provided task is skipped, incorrect, or otherwise incomplete.\nResponses to two instructor provided tasks are skipped, incorrect, or otherwise incomplete.\nResponse to three instructor provided tasks are skipped, incorrect, or otherwise incomplete.\nLess than half of the instructor-provided tasks were successfully completed.\nReport exhibits particularly creative insights beyond instructor specifications.\n\n\nFormatting & Display\nTables have well-formatted column names, suitable numbers of digits, and attractive presentation. Table has a suitable caption.\nColumn names and digits are well-chosen, but formatting could be improved.\nBad column names (opaque variable names or other undefined acronyms)\nUnfiltered ‘data dump’ instead of curated table.\nNo tables.\nReport includes one or more high-quality graphics (created using R).\n\n\nCode Quality\n\nCode is (near) flawless.\nCode passes all styler and lintr type analyses without issue.\n\nComments give context of the analysis, not simply defining functions used in a particular line.\nCode has well-chosen variable names and basic comments.\nCode executes properly, but is difficult to read.\nCode fails to execute properly.\nCode takes advantage of advanced Quarto features to improve presentation of results.\n\n\nData Preparation\nAutomatic (10/10). Out of scope for this mini-project\n\n\n\n\nReport modifies instructor-provided import code to use additional columns or data sources in a way that creates novel insights.\n\n\n\nNote that this rubric is designed with copious opportunities for extra credit if students go above and beyond the instructor-provided scaffolding. Students pursuing careers in data analytics are strongly encouraged to go beyond the strict ambit of the mini-projects to i) further refine their skills; ii) learn additional techniques that can be used in the final course project; and iii) develop a more impressive professional portfolio.\nBecause students are encouraged to use STA/OPR 9750 mini-projects as the basis for a professional portfolio, the basic skeleton of each project will be released under a fairly permissive usage license. Take advantage of it!\nSubmission Instructions\nAfter completing the analysis, write up your findings, showing all of your code, using a dynamic quarto document and post it to your course repository. The qmd file should be named mp01.qmd so the rendered document can be found at docs/mp01.html in the student’s repository and served at the URL:\n\nhttps://&lt;GITHUB_ID&gt;.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp01.html\n\nOnce you confirm this website works (substituting &lt;GITHUB_ID&gt; for the actual GitHub username provided to the professor in MP#00 of course), open a new issue at\n\nhttps://github.com/&lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&gt;/STA9750-2024-FALL/issues/new .\n\nTitle the issue STA9750 &lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&gt; MiniProject #01 and fill in the following text for the issue:\nHi @michaelweylandt!\n\nI've uploaded my work for MiniProject #01 - check it out!\n\nhttps://&lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&gt;.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp01.html\nOnce the submission deadline passes, the instructor will tag classmates for peer feedback in this issue thread.\nAdditionally, a PDF export of this report should be submitted on Brightspace. To create a PDF from the uploaded report, simply use your browser’s ‘Print to PDF’ functionality.\nNB: The analysis outline below specifies key tasks you need to perform within your write up. Your peer evaluators will check that you complete these. You are encouraged to do extra analysis, but the bolded Tasks are mandatory.\nNB: Your final submission should look like a report, not simply a list of facts answering questions. Add introductions, conclusions, and your own commentary. You should be practicing both raw coding skills and written communication in all mini-projects. There is little value in data points stated without context or motivation."

Even more advanced is the gt package.\nThis is useful, but not exactly what we want. Here, the UPT column refers to Unlinked Passenger Trips, which is a measure of rides (controlling for connections and transfers), and VRM refers to Vehicle Revenue Miles, roughly how far the transit provider travelled in total. Some of the other column names are less helpful, so let’s rename them using the rename function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1 - Creating Syntatic Names\n\n\n\nRename a column: UZA Name to metro_area.\n\n\nBecause they have no spaces in them, these names will be easier to manipulate in code. Recall that non-syntactic names (names with spaces, punctuation, or strange characters) have to be quoted in backticks or quotes (depending on the context), while most tidyverse functions take syntactic names without quotes.\nThe Mode column is also helpful, but it uses a set of codes that aren’t interpretable. To make life easier for ourselves, let’s use a case_when statement to transform this into something we can make sense of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Recoding the Mode column\n\n\n\nFirst, find the unique Mode codes in our data using the distinct function. Next, examine the NTD website and find the interpretations of these codes. Complete the following snippet to recode the Mode column.\n\n## This code needs to be modified\nUSAGE &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n    mutate(Mode=case_when(\n        Mode == \"HR\" ~ \"Heavy Rail\", \n        ...\n        ...\n        TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"))\n\n\n\nNow that your data is clean, you may want to create an attractive summary table of your cleaned up USAGE table using the following snippet:\n\nif(!require(\"DT\")) install.packages(\"DT\")\nlibrary(DT)\n\nsample_n(USAGE, 1000) |&gt; \n    mutate(month=as.character(month)) |&gt; \n    DT::datatable()\n\nTo make your table cleaner, you might want to modify this code to unselect the NTD ID and 3 Mode columns and/or rename the UPT and VRM columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Answering Instructor Specified Questions with dplyr\n\n\n\nUsing functions we have studied in class, including filter, group_by, summarize, arrange, answer the following questions in your analysis:\n\nWhat transit agency had the most total VRM in this sample?\nWhat transit mode had the most total VRM in this sample?\nHow many trips were taken on the NYC Subway (Heavy Rail) in May 2024?\nWhat mode of transport had the longest average trip in May 2024?\nHow much did NYC subway ridership fall between April 2019 and April 2020?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Explore and Analyze\n\n\n\nFind three more interesting transit facts in this data other than those above.\n\n\nWe are now ready to combine these usage statistics with the revenue and expenses data. Because our fare data is for 2022 total, we need to convert our usage table to 2022 summary info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Table Summarization\n\n\n\nCreate a new table from USAGE that has annual summary UPT and VRM for 2022. This will require use of the group_by, summarize, and filter functions. You will also want to use the year function, to extract a year from the month column.\nThe resulting table should have the following columns:\n\nNTD ID\nAgency\n\nmetro_area,\nMode\nUPT\nVRM\n\nMake sure to ungroup your table after creating it.\nName this table USAGE_2022_ANNUAL.\n\n\nOnce you have created this new table, you can merge it to the FINANCIALS data as follows:\n\nUSAGE_AND_FINANCIALS &lt;- left_join(USAGE_2022_ANNUAL, \n           FINANCIALS, \n           join_by(`NTD ID`, Mode)) |&gt;\n    drop_na()\n\nNote that the name fields differ between the ridership and financials tables, so it’s a good thing we had the unique identifier NTD ID to rely on.\nWe are now finally ready to our original question about farebox recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6: Farebox Recovery Among Major Systems\n\n\n\nUsing the USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS table, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) had the most UPT in 2022?\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) had the highest farebox recovery, defined as the highest ratio of Total Fares to Expenses?\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per UPT?\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per UPT?\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per VRM?\nWhich transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per VRM?\n\nYou may wish to restrict your answer to major transit systems, which you can define as those with 400,000 UPT per annum.\n\n\nBased on all of this, what do you believe to be the most efficient transit system in the country? (Your answer may differ depending on which form of ‘efficiency’ you care most about)\n\nThis work ©2024 by Michael Weylandt is licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license."

R, like its predecessor the S language, is optimized for interactive, data-analytic work, in contrast with python, which is optimized for general purpose computing.\nR is a programming language and runtime; we will supplement it with RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment or, less formally, an editor.

It is not guaranteed to be accurate at all times - and “the AI told me to” is not a valid excuse if your code is wrong - but on balance, it should be useful.\n\nWe won’t use it this week, but you will need to install Quarto before starting on Mini-Project #00.\n\n\ngit is a source-code management tool, used by developers to manage the code they write. If you’ve ever been part of a large project and struggled to coordinate all team members using the same version of a document, git exists to solve that problem.\nIf you don’t have git pre-installed, install either Git for Windows or the XCode Command Line Tools for MacOS. If not automatically prompted when you try to use git, the Mac install can be manually triggered by running xcode-select --install at a command line.\nIn this course, we will use three main functions of git:\n\n\nstaging: telling git, I want you to prepare to save a certain file\n\ncommitting: saving a set of related changes\n\npushing: copying your committed changes to a separate server for sharing and backup\n\nWhenever you write code you are happy with, you should use git to save it. Saving changes with git is cheap and easy - so do it regularly. You always want git to have a backup of good code in case you loose power, accidentally delete a file, break something in a way you’re not sure how to undo, etc..\nRStudio comes with powerful git integration. Once you have created a project, you should see a tab labelled “Git” in the top right corner of your IDE window that looks something like this:\n\nTo stage a file - prepare to save it - click the empty check box next to the file name. A new file shows a status of “?” - this is git saying “I’ve never seen this file before. Do you want me to track it for you?”. Later, when you make further changes to file you have already asked git to track, a status of “M” (for Modified) will be shown.\nOn its own staging a file does nothing. You also need to commit it for git to truly track it.1 The Commit button will commit all staged changes. When you make a commit, git requires a brief message summarizing the changes. There’s no particular formatting requirement to this message, but it should be something that future-you is able to easily understand. For instance, the commit message from the initial draft of this document reads as:\nInitial draft of Lab 01 (STA9750)\n\n- Installing R and RStudio\n- Git and GitHub\n- Leaflet Example for Styler\n\nTODO: Fuller shell explainers\nTODO: Link more git help\nWhen I read this, I know the purpose of the change I made (first line), the contents of that change (list), and parts that still need more work.\nFinally, after you save a change, it is only saved on your computer. The true power of git comes from its ability to copy changes and backups across machines. This gives you an easy way to store backups in case your computer dies and makes collaboration efficient and fun. git allows you to push and pull changes between machines in endlessly powerful (but sometimes complex) ways. For this course, we’ll keep things simple and only use GitHub to share code. We discuss GitHub in the next section.\nReference: We will not use all of the functionality of git in this course, but you should familiarize yourself with Chapters 1, 2, and 6 of the Git Book over the next two weeks.\n\nGitHub is an industry-standard code hosting and collaboration platform. In addition to hosting copies of code, GitHub provides web hosting, bug reporting, code review, continuous integration, documentation wikis, and discussion fora. You will explore GitHub in more detail starting in Mini-Project #00.\n\n\nA major theme of this course will be sharing and co-developing code with your classmates, both for peer feedback and for the course project. Code sharing is hard! Everyone writes code a little differently and what is clear to you may not be clear at all to your reader.\nTo make code sharing just a bit easier, we use tools to ensure all code shared in this course is consistently formatted. By using consistent formatting, you reduce the cognitive load on your reader, making it easier for them to focus on the ideas of your code, not how you chose to write it.\nA major strength of R is its huge number of user-contributed packages. These are “add-ins” which provide additional functionality not available in the basic version of R. As of 2024-08-26, there are over 21 thousand packages available on CRAN, the largest official repository of R packages. Beyond all those, there are thousands more packages available on other code hosting websites like GitHub.2\nWe will use the contributed styler package to format code in this course. Run the following command to automatically download and install the styler package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"styler\")\n\n(Use the clipboard icon on the right of code snippets to automatically copy code suitable for pasting into RStudio.)\nYou should see something like this:\n\nThe styler package has been downloaded and installed on your computer, but it is not yet “active” or “open” in R. In general, you will only need to download packages once, but you will need to load them each time you want to use them.3\nOpen a R file in RStudio and copy the following (ugly) code:\n\nif(!require(\"leaflet\")) install.packages(\"leaflet\")\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")){\n    install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n   }\n library(tidyverse)\n     library(rvest)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\npAGE = read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College')\n  pAGE |&gt; html_element(\".latitude\") |&gt; html_text2() -&gt; BaruchLatitude\n  baruch_longitude &lt;- pAGE |&gt; html_element(\".longitude\") |&gt; html_text2()\n  \n    BaruchLatitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(BaruchLatitude, \n                                     \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) * (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)\n baruch_longitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) * \n                             (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)\n  \nleaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, zoom=17) %&gt;%\n    addPopups(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, \"Look! It's &lt;b&gt;Baruch College&lt;/b&gt;!\")\n\nYou don’t need to understand what this does just yet, but it’s hopefully clear that this is ugly code. Nothing is lined up properly, capitalization is erratic, and different coding styles are intermixed rather recklessly.\nNear the top of your RStudio pane, you will see a drop-down menu titled Addins. If you successfully installed styler above, one of the Addins choices will be “style active file.” Click this and the code will be cleaned up (a bit) resulting in something like this:\n\nif (!require(\"leaflet\")) install.packages(\"leaflet\")\nif (!require(\"tidyverse\")) {\n  install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\npAGE &lt;- read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College\")\npAGE |&gt;\n  html_element(\".latitude\") |&gt;\n  html_text2() -&gt; BaruchLatitude\nbaruch_longitude &lt;- pAGE |&gt;\n  html_element(\".longitude\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nBaruchLatitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(\n  BaruchLatitude,\n  \"[^0123456789]\"\n)[[1]]) * (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)\nbaruch_longitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) *\n  (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nleaflet() %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  setView(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, zoom = 17) %&gt;%\n  addPopups(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, \"Look! It's &lt;b&gt;Baruch College&lt;/b&gt;!\")\n\nIt’s far from perfect - and we will discuss the many issues in this example throughout the course - but it’s better! At a minimum, you should make sure to run styler like this on all code you submit during this course.\nAnd now that your code is cleaned up, you should run it! The Source button in the top right corner will run all code in the open file. Running the code produces something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot too shabby! That’s an interactive, dynamic map showing the location of Baruch College obtained by parsing the Baruch Wikipedia page, getting the GPS coordinates of Baruch, downloading a map file, and locating Baruch on that map.\nChallenge: Adjust this code to show Hunter college instead of Baruch.\n\nIf you want even more feedback on writing good code, install the lintr package and use the associated RStudio add-in. Unlike styler, lintr won’t make changes automatically for you, but it will highlight much more subtle possible problems.4\n\nTo become a true “power user” of tools like R and python, you will need to become more familiar with the command line interface (CLI) and associated tools.5\nThe Software Carpentry Unix Shell Tutorial is a great introduction to shell usage. Check it out!\nNB: MacOS and Linux systems work quite similarly under the hood, as both descend from the Unix tradition. By contrast, Windows works somewhat differently. Learners whose personal machine runs Windows are encouraged to take advantage of the provided Linux-running virtual machines6 as they work through this section.\n\n\nNext week, we will use these tools to begin coding in earnest. If you’re feeling ambitious, go ahead and get started on Mini-Project #00."

Instead of saving everything every time, there is great power in only saving “good” or “finished” changes to a large project, while leaving work-in-progress elsewhere unsaved. You probably won’t need this level of control until you get to the course project, but it’s better to have it than not.↩︎\nIf you are interested in bioinformatics, the Bioconductor project develops incredible open-source R packages.↩︎\nWhile this may feel cumbersome, it’s really not dissimilar to any other software you use (or R itself). You need to download it once, but you need to open it each time you intend to use it. There’s no harm in re-downloading–free software!–but it wastes time and bandwidth. Since we benefit so much from the free-software community, the very least we can do is not run up their internet bills unnecessarily.↩︎\nSome of the issues identified by lintr may be false positives, but the false positive rate is quite low, especially for the sort of procedural code that is the focus of this course. You should default to trying to appease lintr, but feel free to use the course discussion board for any questions.↩︎\nAs an added benefit, use of the CLI also makes you look like a 90s movie hacker to all your friends.↩︎\nSee the Course Resources page.↩︎"

    "text": "In lieu of traditional homework, this course has a set of four mini-projects, which will be assessed in two stages. In the first, you will complete a small data analysis project1; after submission of your analysis, it will be assigned to a classmate, who will evaluate it according to an instructor-provided rubric. This peer feedback stage is an opportunity to see how your classmates answered questions and to compare it to your own response. In doing so, you will learn to evaluate data science work product and will develop a critical eye that can be turned to your own work.\nThis mini-project, however, is a meta-mini-project, designed to help you set up the course infrastructure you will use for the four graded mini-projects.\nNB: Mini-Project #00 is not graded, but it is required. For STA/OPR 9750, it serves as the legally mandated Verification of Enrollment activity. If it is not completed on time, you may be involuntarily disenrolled from the course.\nEstimated Time: 2 hours.\nThis course will use the industry-standard code sharing platform GitHub. Mini-projects and course-projects will be submitted by posting to a relevant GitHub project and creating a world-readable HTML page. A secondary goal of this course is to help students build a web-presence and a data science portfolio, giving you a place to showcase your skills to potential employers. The four mini-projects and the final course project should form an excellent basis for a portfolio. The main aim of Mini-Project #00 is to set up the “skeleton” of this portfolio.\nYou may choose to complete these tasks under a pseudonym if you do not want current or potential employers, classmates, or the world at large to see your work. You will be required to disclose your pseudonym to the instructor. If you choose to use a pseudonym, it will be straightforward to add your name to any or all coursework after the semester ends. Within the course, you will have the option to switch to a pseudonym as desired, but it is difficult to fully anonymize anything once it has been posted on the public internet. With all those cautions, please take a moment to reflect as to whether you wish to proceed under your own name or using a pseudonym."

    "text": "Stage 2: Course Repo Creation\n\nCreating GitHub Repo\nNow that you have created a GitHub account, log in and proceed to your dashboard at https://github.com. In the top right corner, click the + symbol and select “New Repository.”2\n\nCreate a new repository named STA9750-2024-FALL with a suitable description.\n\nThis repo needs to be public. You do not need to select a README, .gitignore, or a license at this time.\nAfter you create your repo, you should see a page like this:\n\nNote the URL highlighted in the main box:\n**https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/STA9750-2024-FALL.git**\nYou will need this in the next step.\n\n\nConnecting GitHub Repo to RStudio\nNow that you have set up an empty repo, you need to connect it to your personal machine and to RStudio. RStudio’s concept of projects roughly map to GitHub repos and that is what we will use here.\nOpen RStudio and click the project menu in the top right corner:\n\nFollow through the menu to click:\n\nNew Project\nVersion Control\nGit\n\nThis will take you to the following screen:\n\nCopy the .git URL from the previous step into Repository URL.3\n\n\nSecuring Connections to GitHub\nAn important aspect of source code management is access control to your code repository. While it’s typically no risk to make your code world-readable, you don’t want just anyone being able to add code to your repository. Traditionally, this type of access would be controlled with a username+password scheme, but GitHub has moved to a Access Token structure.\nThis process is a “one-time” task, documented in the Connect Section of the Happy Git with R book, but we’ll cover the highlights here.\n\nGit Credential Manager\nBefore starting, you will want to make sure you have installed the Git Credential Manager (GCM). If you used the Git for Windows bundle, you already have GCM installed. If you are on a Mac, you can download the GCM installer directly or install GCM via the GitHub Desktop Client.\n\n\nGitHub Personal Access Token\nNext, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub. You can think of this as a “special-purpose” password. Unlike your general account password, a PAT can be restricted to only perform certain activities or only for a limited time period.\nAfter logging in to GitHub via a web browser, visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new to begin the token creation process. Give the token a meaningful name and description and set an expiration date after (at least) the end of the semester.\nSet the “Repository Access” to “All repositories” and, under “Permissions &gt; Repository Permissions”, set “Contents” to “Read and Write”. This will now let anyone using your token read and write to all your repositories. After you create your token, you will be given only one opportunity to copy it. (Note that you can change permissions later, but you can only copy the token once.) Copy this and save it for later use. If you loose this token, you may need to generate a new one.\nWhen you make your first push to GitHub (as described below), use this token as your password. If everything is set up correctly, GCM will save this token and use it to authenticate you every time you push to GitHub. You should not need to paste this token every time.\n\n\n\nInitial Push\nNow, to make sure everything is working, let’s save a basic README file and push it to GitHub. This is a plain text file with no particular structure.\nTo create it, click the new file button in RStudio (top left; piece of paper with a green plus) and select Text File. RStudio will open this file in the editor: type some basic content, e.g.,\nSubmission materials for STA9750 at Baruch College. \n\nOwner: &lt;YOURNAME&gt;\n(It doesn’t matter what you push: whatever you type will be the default text appearing when someone visits your repo.)\nSave the file and open the Git pane in RStudio.\n\nCheck the box next to the README file to stage it for git.\n\nThen click the Commit button a type a brief message (Initial commit is fine).\n\nFinally, push the Push button. If everything works, you should see a screen like the below:\n\nTo confirm everything worked, return to the GitHub repo in your browser. You should see the text of your README file displayed at the bottom of the page."

Replace &lt;THEME&gt; with a lower case version of the theme name; if you want to use the Sandstone theme used for this course website, &lt;THEME&gt; will be sandstone.\nOnce you have created this _quarto.yml, stage it (click the check mark) in RStudio’s git pane.\n\n\nindex.qmd\nNext, we’ll build your home page, conventionally called index.html. We will not write the HTML code by hand - it’s quite cumbersome - and will instead let quarto create it for us. Create another plain text file and save it as index.qmd.\nThis file will be divided into two parts, a header giving the metadata for the site, and a body, giving the content of the site.\nFirst write the header, separated by three horizontal bars (minus signs) above and below. For now, all you need to specify is a title:\n---\ntitle: \"YOUR TITLE GOES HERE\"\n---\nBelow the header, write the basic content of your website: a brief introduction of who you are.4 You can use markdown here for formatting. Basic text will suffice, but this is also a great opportunity to include things like a personal headshot, a link to a full resume, or similar.\nAs you work on this, click the “Render” button at the top of the editor pane to see what your site will look like.\nOnce you are happy with this landing page, stage it and we’ll move on to building the website properly.\n\n\nbuild_site.R\nFinally, open a new file - but now it’s an R script, not a text file, in RStudio. Copy the following into build_site.R:\n#!/usr/bin/env Rscript\nif(!require(\"quarto\")){\n    install.packages(\"quarto\")\n}\nlibrary(quarto)\nif(!quarto::quarto_binary_sitrep()){\n    stop(\"Something is wrong with your quarto installation.\")\n}\nquarto::quarto_render(\".\")\nsystem(\"git add docs/*\")\nif(!any(grepl(\"rstudio\", search()))){q(\"no\")}\nClick the Source button in the top-right corner of the editor pane to run this code. If everything works, it will build your website and automatically stage it. Stage build_site.R as well.\nFinally, Commit all these staged files and Push them to GitHub. You have now created a website and just need to turn on a web server so you can access it."

(If you have done low-level work before, you might ask where the extra bit went: it’s used for encoding NA values.)\nNumeric: 64-bit (double precision) floating point values, ranging from (approximately) \\(\\pm 10^{308}\\). The detailed behavior of numeric (often called double) data is beyond this course, but it is well documented elsewhwere.\nCharacter: the topic of today’s discussion.\n\nR makes no difference between a character - in the sense of a single letter - and a string: in particular, each element of a character vector is an (arbitrary length) string. Specialized functions are required for work at the true “single letter” scale. If you come from other languages, this behavior might be surprising, but it allows R to handle much of the complexity associated with characters automagically, which greatly simplifies data analysis.\nWhen speaking, we refer to R as using strings, even if R itself calls them character elements for historical reasons."

    "section": "Encoding",
    "text": "Encoding\nHow are strings represented on a computer? The answer has evolved over time, but the current state of the art - used by almost all non-legacy software - is based on the Unicode system and the UTF-8 encoding.\nThe Unicode system is comprised of two essential parts: - A numbered list of “letter-like” elements - Rules for manipulating those elements\nWhile this seems simple, it is anything but. The history of string representations in computers is a long and painful story of programmers repeatedly underestimating the complexity of the seemingly simple task of listing “all the letters.”\nThe Unicode consortium makes a long list of characters that computers should be able to represent: the most recent version of the Unicode standard includes 149,813 characters divided into 161 scripts. These include everything from the basic (Anglo-American) Latin alphabet to the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets to Chinese and Japanese characters to the undeciphered Linear A alphabet and Tengwar, the fictional script used in the Lord of the Rings novels. The Unicode standard also includes a wide set of Emoji (approximately 4000) and many “modifying” characters.\nTo each of these, the Unicode consortium assigns a code point : a numerical identifier. Even superficially similar characters may be assigned different code points to distinguish them: for example, “H” is code point U+0048 with the official description “Latin Capital Letter H” while “Η” is U+0397, “Greek Capital Letter Eta.”\nThe difference between these characters is essential to know how to manipulate them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tolower function to lower-case each of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unicode standard defines the lower case mapping of U+0048 as the Latin lower case h, while the lower case mapping of U+0397 as the Greek lower case eta, which looks something like a streched n. \nIn general, these mappings are incredibly complicated and depend not only on the specific code point, but also the set of translation rules being used. (Certain languages have different lower/upper mappings for what are otherwise the same letter.)\nWhile you don’t need to know all of this complexity, it is essential to know that it’s out there and to rely on battle-tested libraries to perform these mappings.\nUnicode is supplemented by the UTF-8 encodings, which controls how 0/1-bit strings are actually translated to code points. (Fonts then map code points to what you see on the screen.) UTF-8 is more-or-less back-compatible with other major encodings, so it’s a good default. When dealing with modern websites or public data sources, they almost always present their contents in a UTF-8 compatible encoding (if not UTF-8 proper) so you should be ok.\nA well-formatted website will state its encoding near the top of the page:\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nread_html(\"https://baruch.cuny.edu\") |&gt;\n    html_elements(\"meta[charset]\") |&gt;\n    html_attr(\"charset\")\n\n[1] \"UTF-8\"\n\n\nAdvice: Whenever possible, make sure you are using UTF-8 strings: if your data is not UTF-8, reencode it to UTF-8 as soon as possible. This will save you much pain."

    "text": "String Manipulation\nOnce data is in R and encoded as UTF-8 Unicode points, we have several tools for dealing with strings. Your first port of call should be the stringr package.\nAll the functions of the stringr package start with str_ and take a vector of strings as the first argument, making them well suited for chained analysis.\nLet’s start with str_length which simply computes the length of each element. For the basic Latin alphabet, this more or less matches our intuition:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nx &lt;- c(\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"Baruch.\")\nstr_length(x)\n\n[1] 1 2 1 7 2 7\n\n\nbut it can be tricky for strings that involve Unicode combining characters.\n\nstr_length(\"X̅\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere the “overbar” is a combining character which we add on to the X. This is commonly (though not always) used for languages with accents (e.g. French) or for languages where vowels are written above and below the main script (Arabic or Hebrew). This same idea is used for certain Emoji constructs:\n\nstr_length(\"👨🏿\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere, “Man with Dark Skin Tone” is the combination of “Man” and “Dark Skin Tone.” (Compare how this appears in the rendered document to how RStudio prints it.)\nWhile there is complexity in all of Unicode, str_length will behave as you might expect for “regular” text. I’m going to stop showing the “scary case” of Unicode, but you should be aware of it for the remainder of these exercises.\n\nConcatenation\nYou have already seen the base paste and paste0 functions for combining two string vectors together.\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Michael\", \"Mary\", \"Gus\")\ny &lt;- c(\"Son\", \"Daughter\", \"Dog\")\n\npaste(x, y)\n\n[1] \"Michael Son\"   \"Mary Daughter\" \"Gus Dog\"      \n\n\nBy default, paste combines strings with a space between them, while paste0 omits the space. paste is typically what you want for strings for human reading, while paste0 is a better guess for computer-oriented text (e.g., putting together a URL).\nYou can change the separator by passing a sep argument to paste:\n\npaste(x, y, sep = \" is my \")\n\n[1] \"Michael is my Son\"   \"Mary is my Daughter\" \"Gus is my Dog\"      \n\n\nYou can also combine together multiple elements of a vector using the collapse argument:\n\npaste(x, collapse = \" and \")\n\n[1] \"Michael and Mary and Gus\"\n\n\n\nExercises:\nUsing the paste function, make a vector of strings like “John’s favorite color is blue”:\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\nModify your answer to write a (run-on) sentence of favorite colors: “John’s favorite color is blue and Jane’s favorite color is orange and …”\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\n\n\n\nSubstring Selection\nWhen cleaning up data for analysis, it is common to need to take substrings from larger text. The str_sub function will do this:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"How\", \"much\", \"is\", \"that\", \"puppy\", \"in\", \"the\", \"window?\")\nstr_sub(x, 1, 2)\n\n[1] \"Ho\" \"mu\" \"is\" \"th\" \"pu\" \"in\" \"th\" \"wi\"\n\n\nIf you want to go all the way to the end, set the end element to -1:\n\nstr_sub(x, 2, -1)\n\n[1] \"ow\"     \"uch\"    \"s\"      \"hat\"    \"uppy\"   \"n\"      \"he\"     \"indow?\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUsing str_sub, remove the system name (CUNY or UC) and return only the campus name:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nuc_schools &lt;- c(\"UC Berkeley\", \"UC San Diego\", \"UC Santa Cruz\", \"UC Davis\")\ncuny_schools &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"City College, CUNY\", \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nDetect and Matching\nOften we only need to know whether a particular substring is present in a larger string. We can use str_detect to do this:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_detect(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nThe str_match function will return the text of the match. Here it’s useless, but we’ll see that it becomes more powerful when we allow more flexible pattern specifications.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_match(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n     [,1]   \n[1,] \"hound\"\n[2,] \"hound\"\n[3,] NA     \n[4,] NA     \n[5,] \"hound\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUse str_detect to find the CUNY schools:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nschools &lt;- c(\"UC Davis\", \n             \"UC Santa Cruz\", \n             \"City College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC Berkeley\", \n             \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\", \n             \"Baruch College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC San Diego\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Patterns\nWhile working by individual characters is sometimes useful (for very regular data), we generally need more powerful tools: regular expressions (RE) provide a compact language for specifying patterns in strings. We’ll introduce the basics here to help with string functions and then explore some more advanced RE features.\nThe most basic pattern is a set of elements in brackets: this means “any of these”.\nFor example, we want to see which names have an “A” in them:\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Jane\", \"Rhonda\", \"Reggie\", \"Bernie\", \"Walter\", \"Arthur\")\nstr_detect(names, \"a\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"A\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"[Aa]\") ## Right!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nAlternatively, we can see which strings contain numbers:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"73 cows\", \"47 chickens\", \"a dozen eggs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nIf we use str_match we can pull out the matching element:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"3 soups\", \"5 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nBy default, this only finds one appearance of the pattern:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"23 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"56 fish\")\n\n# Why is this wrong?\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nWe can modify the pattern specifier to include count information. The basic behavior is to add explicit count bounds:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"567 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2}\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] NA  \n[2,] \"34\"\n[3,] \"56\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] NA   \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\n\nHere a single number is an exact count ({2}), while pairs ({2,3}) specify a range. If one end of the range is left empty, it is 0 or infinite (depending on the direction).\nCertain count specifications are sufficiently useful to get their own syntax:\n\nOne or more: + is equivalent to {1,}\nZero or more: * is equivalent to {0,}\nOne or zero: ? is equivalent to {0,1}.\n\nUse these specifications for the next set of exercises.\n\nExercises\nWhich strings contain a three digit number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining patterns\nYou can combine REs to make more complex patterns:\n\n(a|b) means a or b. This is like [] notation but a, b can be more complex than single characters\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"UC Berkeley\", \"Harvard University\")\nstr_detect(x, \"(CUNY|UC)\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n[^abc] means anything other than a, b, c. You can often achieve a similar effect using the negate argument to str_detect, but you need this specifically for str_match\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"10 blue fish\", \"three wet goats\", \"15 otters in hats\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[^0123456789]\")\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\n^ outside of a bracket denotes the start of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"rum\", \"white rum\", \"flavored rum\")\nstr_detect(x, \"^rum\")\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n$ denotes the end of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"bourbon whiskey\", \"scotch whisky\", \"whiskey liqueurs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"whisk[e]?y$\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nSee the stringr RE docs for more examples of regular expressions.\n\nExercises\n\nUse a regular expression to find which of these are fish species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a regular expression to find words with three or more vowels in a row:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the words where “q” is not followed by a “u”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacement\nThe str_replace function allows us to replace a string with something else. This is particularly useful when cleaning up text:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Manhattan, NY\", \"Bronx, New York\", \"Brooklyn, ny\", \"Queens, nY\")\nstr_replace(x, \"([nN][yY]|New York)\", \"NY\")\n\n[1] \"Manhattan, NY\" \"Bronx, NY\"     \"Brooklyn, NY\"  \"Queens, NY\""

For example, there are dedicated zip codes for the IRS and the Department of Defense that have no associated geographic boundaries. Most open data sources will omit this distinction, but if you see it, you should be aware of it.↩︎"
