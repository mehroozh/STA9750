Roughly, this means that most weeks, students will be asked to complete a small pre-assignment each week to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week’s lecture. Each class period will be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more detail and an extended lab activity designed to build familiarity and fluency with that week’s subject matter."

(If you have done low-level work before, you might ask where the extra bit went: it’s used for encoding NA values.)\nNumeric: 64-bit (double precision) floating point values, ranging from (approximately) \\(\\pm 10^{308}\\). The detailed behavior of numeric (often called double) data is beyond this course, but it is well documented elsewhwere.\nCharacter: the topic of today’s discussion.\n\nR makes no difference between a character - in the sense of a single letter - and a string: in particular, each element of a character vector is an (arbitrary length) string. Specialized functions are required for work at the true “single letter” scale. If you come from other languages, this behavior might be surprising, but it allows R to handle much of the complexity associated with characters automagically, which greatly simplifies data analysis.\nWhen speaking, we refer to R as using strings, even if R itself calls them character elements for historical reasons."

    "title": "STA 9750 Week 12 Pre-Assignment: Strings and Things",
    "section": "Encoding",
    "text": "Encoding\nHow are strings represented on a computer? The answer has evolved over time, but the current state of the art - used by almost all non-legacy software - is based on the Unicode system and the UTF-8 encoding.\nThe Unicode system is comprised of two essential parts: - A numbered list of “letter-like” elements - Rules for manipulating those elements\nWhile this seems simple, it is anything but. The history of string representations in computers is a long and painful story of programmers repeatedly underestimating the complexity of the seemingly simple task of listing “all the letters.”\nThe Unicode consortium makes a long list of characters that computers should be able to represent: the most recent version of the Unicode standard includes 149,813 characters divided into 161 scripts. These include everything from the basic (Anglo-American) Latin alphabet to the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets to Chinese and Japanese characters to the undeciphered Linear A alphabet and Tengwar, the fictional script used in the Lord of the Rings novels. The Unicode standard also includes a wide set of Emoji (approximately 4000) and many “modifying” characters.\nTo each of these, the Unicode consortium assigns a code point : a numerical identifier. Even superficially similar characters may be assigned different code points to distinguish them: for example, “H” is code point U+0048 with the official description “Latin Capital Letter H” while “Η” is U+0397, “Greek Capital Letter Eta.”\nThe difference between these characters is essential to know how to manipulate them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tolower function to lower-case each of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unicode standard defines the lower case mapping of U+0048 as the Latin lower case h, while the lower case mapping of U+0397 as the Greek lower case eta, which looks something like a streched n. \nIn general, these mappings are incredibly complicated and depend not only on the specific code point, but also the set of translation rules being used. (Certain languages have different lower/upper mappings for what are otherwise the same letter.)\nWhile you don’t need to know all of this complexity, it is essential to know that it’s out there and to rely on battle-tested libraries to perform these mappings.\nUnicode is supplemented by the UTF-8 encodings, which controls how 0/1-bit strings are actually translated to code points. (Fonts then map code points to what you see on the screen.) UTF-8 is more-or-less back-compatible with other major encodings, so it’s a good default. When dealing with modern websites or public data sources, they almost always present their contents in a UTF-8 compatible encoding (if not UTF-8 proper) so you should be ok.\nA well-formatted website will state its encoding near the top of the page:\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nread_html(\"https://baruch.cuny.edu\") |&gt;\n    html_elements(\"meta[charset]\") |&gt;\n    html_attr(\"charset\")\n\n[1] \"UTF-8\"\n\n\nAdvice: Whenever possible, make sure you are using UTF-8 strings: if your data is not UTF-8, reencode it to UTF-8 as soon as possible. This will save you much pain."

    "title": "STA 9750 Week 12 Pre-Assignment: Strings and Things",
    "section": "String Manipulation",
    "text": "String Manipulation\nOnce data is in R and encoded as UTF-8 Unicode points, we have several tools for dealing with strings. Your first port of call should be the stringr package.\nAll the functions of the stringr package start with str_ and take a vector of strings as the first argument, making them well suited for chained analysis.\nLet’s start with str_length which simply computes the length of each element. For the basic Latin alphabet, this more or less matches our intuition:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nx &lt;- c(\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"Baruch.\")\nstr_length(x)\n\n[1] 1 2 1 7 2 7\n\n\nbut it can be tricky for strings that involve Unicode combining characters.\n\nstr_length(\"X̅\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere the “overbar” is a combining character which we add on to the X. This is commonly (though not always) used for languages with accents (e.g. French) or for languages where vowels are written above and below the main script (Arabic or Hebrew). This same idea is used for certain Emoji constructs:\n\nstr_length(\"👨🏿\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere, “Man with Dark Skin Tone” is the combination of “Man” and “Dark Skin Tone.” (Compare how this appears in the rendered document to how RStudio prints it.)\nWhile there is complexity in all of Unicode, str_length will behave as you might expect for “regular” text. I’m going to stop showing the “scary case” of Unicode, but you should be aware of it for the remainder of these exercises.\n\nConcatenation\nYou have already seen the base paste and paste0 functions for combining two string vectors together.\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Michael\", \"Mary\", \"Gus\")\ny &lt;- c(\"Son\", \"Daughter\", \"Dog\")\n\npaste(x, y)\n\n[1] \"Michael Son\"   \"Mary Daughter\" \"Gus Dog\"      \n\n\nBy default, paste combines strings with a space between them, while paste0 omits the space. paste is typically what you want for strings for human reading, while paste0 is a better guess for computer-oriented text (e.g., putting together a URL).\nYou can change the separator by passing a sep argument to paste:\n\npaste(x, y, sep = \" is my \")\n\n[1] \"Michael is my Son\"   \"Mary is my Daughter\" \"Gus is my Dog\"      \n\n\nYou can also combine together multiple elements of a vector using the collapse argument:\n\npaste(x, collapse = \" and \")\n\n[1] \"Michael and Mary and Gus\"\n\n\n\nExercises:\nUsing the paste function, make a vector of strings like “John’s favorite color is blue”:\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\nModify your answer to write a (run-on) sentence of favorite colors: “John’s favorite color is blue and Jane’s favorite color is orange and …”\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\n\n\n\nSubstring Selection\nWhen cleaning up data for analysis, it is common to need to take substrings from larger text. The str_sub function will do this:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"How\", \"much\", \"is\", \"that\", \"puppy\", \"in\", \"the\", \"window?\")\nstr_sub(x, 1, 2)\n\n[1] \"Ho\" \"mu\" \"is\" \"th\" \"pu\" \"in\" \"th\" \"wi\"\n\n\nIf you want to go all the way to the end, set the end element to -1:\n\nstr_sub(x, 2, -1)\n\n[1] \"ow\"     \"uch\"    \"s\"      \"hat\"    \"uppy\"   \"n\"      \"he\"     \"indow?\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUsing str_sub, remove the system name (CUNY or UC) and return only the campus name:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nuc_schools &lt;- c(\"UC Berkeley\", \"UC San Diego\", \"UC Santa Cruz\", \"UC Davis\")\ncuny_schools &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"City College, CUNY\", \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nDetect and Matching\nOften we only need to know whether a particular substring is present in a larger string. We can use str_detect to do this:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_detect(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nThe str_match function will return the text of the match. Here it’s useless, but we’ll see that it becomes more powerful when we allow more flexible pattern specifications.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_match(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n     [,1]   \n[1,] \"hound\"\n[2,] \"hound\"\n[3,] NA     \n[4,] NA     \n[5,] \"hound\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUse str_detect to find the CUNY schools:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nschools &lt;- c(\"UC Davis\", \n             \"UC Santa Cruz\", \n             \"City College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC Berkeley\", \n             \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\", \n             \"Baruch College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC San Diego\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Patterns\nWhile working by individual characters is sometimes useful (for very regular data), we generally need more powerful tools: regular expressions (RE) provide a compact language for specifying patterns in strings. We’ll introduce the basics here to help with string functions and then explore some more advanced RE features.\nThe most basic pattern is a set of elements in brackets: this means “any of these”.\nFor example, we want to see which names have an “A” in them:\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Jane\", \"Rhonda\", \"Reggie\", \"Bernie\", \"Walter\", \"Arthur\")\nstr_detect(names, \"a\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"A\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"[Aa]\") ## Right!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nAlternatively, we can see which strings contain numbers:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"73 cows\", \"47 chickens\", \"a dozen eggs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nIf we use str_match we can pull out the matching element:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"3 soups\", \"5 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nBy default, this only finds one appearance of the pattern:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"23 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"56 fish\")\n\n# Why is this wrong?\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nWe can modify the pattern specifier to include count information. The basic behavior is to add explicit count bounds:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"567 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2}\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] NA  \n[2,] \"34\"\n[3,] \"56\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] NA   \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\n\nHere a single number is an exact count ({2}), while pairs ({2,3}) specify a range. If one end of the range is left empty, it is 0 or infinite (depending on the direction).\nCertain count specifications are sufficiently useful to get their own syntax:\n\nOne or more: + is equivalent to {1,}\nZero or more: * is equivalent to {0,}\nOne or zero: ? is equivalent to {0,1}.\n\nUse these specifications for the next set of exercises.\n\nExercises\nWhich strings contain a three digit number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining patterns\nYou can combine REs to make more complex patterns:\n\n(a|b) means a or b. This is like [] notation but a, b can be more complex than single characters\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"UC Berkeley\", \"Harvard University\")\nstr_detect(x, \"(CUNY|UC)\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n[^abc] means anything other than a, b, c. You can often achieve a similar effect using the negate argument to str_detect, but you need this specifically for str_match\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"10 blue fish\", \"three wet goats\", \"15 otters in hats\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[^0123456789]\")\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\n^ outside of a bracket denotes the start of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"rum\", \"white rum\", \"flavored rum\")\nstr_detect(x, \"^rum\")\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n$ denotes the end of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"bourbon whiskey\", \"scotch whisky\", \"whiskey liqueurs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"whisk[e]?y$\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nSee the stringr RE docs for more examples of regular expressions.\n\nExercises\n\nUse a regular expression to find which of these are fish species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a regular expression to find words with three or more vowels in a row:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the words where “q” is not followed by a “u”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacement\nThe str_replace function allows us to replace a string with something else. This is particularly useful when cleaning up text:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Manhattan, NY\", \"Bronx, New York\", \"Brooklyn, ny\", \"Queens, nY\")\nstr_replace(x, \"([nN][yY]|New York)\", \"NY\")\n\n[1] \"Manhattan, NY\" \"Bronx, NY\"     \"Brooklyn, NY\"  \"Queens, NY\""

In the first, you will complete a small data analysis project1; after submission of your analysis, it will be assigned to a classmate, who will evaluate it according to an instructor-provided rubric. This peer feedback stage is an opportunity to see how your classmates answered questions and to compare it to your own response. In doing so, you will learn to evaluate data science work product and will develop a critical eye that can be turned to your own work.\nThis mini-project, however, is a meta-mini-project, designed to help you set up the course infrastructure you will use for the four graded mini-projects.\nNB: Mini-Project #00 is not graded, but it is required. For STA/OPR 9750, it serves as the legally mandated Verification of Enrollment activity. If it is not completed on time, you may be involuntarily disenrolled from the course.\nEstimated Time: 2 hours.\nThis course will use the industry-standard code sharing platform GitHub. Mini-projects and course-projects will be submitted by posting to a relevant GitHub project and creating a world-readable HTML page. A secondary goal of this course is to help students build a web-presence and a data science portfolio, giving you a place to showcase your skills to potential employers. The four mini-projects and the final course project should form an excellent basis for a portfolio. The main aim of Mini-Project #00 is to set up the “skeleton” of this portfolio.\nYou may choose to complete these tasks under a pseudonym if you do not want current or potential employers, classmates, or the world at large to see your work. You will be required to disclose your pseudonym to the instructor. If you choose to use a pseudonym, it will be straightforward to add your name to any or all coursework after the semester ends. Within the course, you will have the option to switch to a pseudonym as desired, but it is difficult to fully anonymize anything once it has been posted on the public internet. With all those cautions, please take a moment to reflect as to whether you wish to proceed under your own name or using a pseudonym."

    "text": "Topics:\n\nInstalling R and RStudio\n\nInstalling git\n\nGetting Started on GitHub\n\nBasic Principles of “Clean Code”\n\n\nThe primary programming language used in this course is R, one of the two most popular languages used in data science. R, like its predecessor the S language, is optimized for interactive, data-analytic work, in contrast with python, which is optimized for general purpose computing.\nR is a programming language and runtime; we will supplement it with RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment or, less formally, an editor. RStudio is the software where you will write the code and then the R runtime will execute it.\n\nStudents should first install R from https://cloud.r-project.org/.\n\n\nDon’t fear the 90’s web design! Click image for detailed installation instructions.\n\nAs of 2024-08-26, the most recent version of R is 4.4.1. Using the most current version of R will reduce the likelihood of issues later in the course.\n\nNext, download and install the RStudio IDE (desktop edition).\n\n\nClick image for detailed installation instructions.\n\nRStudio is highly configurable and I recommend taking advantage of all its built-in features. If you go to the Global Options menu (accessible under Tools), I recommend the following settings:\n\nGeneral: Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”.\nGeneral: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”\nCode / Editing: Set “Tab width” to 2\nCode / Editing: Check\n\n“Insert spaces for Tab”\nAuto-detect code indentation\nInsert matching parens / quotes\nUse native pipe operator\nAuto-indent code after paste\nVertically align arguments in auto-indent\nContinue comment when inserting new line\n\n\nCode / Display: Check\n\nShow line numbers\nShow margin (margin column should be 80)\n\n\nCode / Diagnostics: check all “R” diagnostics.\nAppearance: Pick a color theme you enjoy. (I’m partial to light text on a dark background)\n\nYou may wish to enable GitHub Copilot. I have little experience with GH Copilot, but it seems quite popular and is allowed in this course. It is not guaranteed to be accurate at all times - and “the AI told me to” is not a valid excuse if your code is wrong - but on balance, it should be useful.\n\nWe won’t use it this week, but you will need to install Quarto before starting on Mini-Project #00.\n\n\ngit is a source-code management tool, used by developers to manage the code they write. If you’ve ever been part of a large project and struggled to coordinate all team members using the same version of a document, git exists to solve that problem.\nIn this course, we will use three main functions of git:\n\n\nstaging: telling git, I want you to prepare to save a certain file\n\ncommitting: saving a set of related changes\n\npushing: copying your committed changes to a separate server for sharing and backup\n\nWhenever you write code you are happy with, you should use git to save it. Saving changes with git is cheap and easy - so do it regularly. You always want git to have a backup of good code in case you loose power, accidentally delete a file, break something in a way you’re not sure how to undo, etc..\nRStudio comes with powerful git integration. Once you have created a project, you should see a tab labelled “Git” in the top right corner of your IDE window that looks something like this:\n\nTo stage a file - prepare to save it - click the empty check box next to the file name. A new file shows a status of “?” - this is git saying “I’ve never seen this file before. Do you want me to track it for you?”. Later, when you make further changes to file you have already asked git to track, a status of “M” (for Modified) will be shown.\nOn its own staging a file does nothing. You also need to commit it for git to truly track it.1 The Commit button will commit all staged changes. When you make a commit, git requires a brief message summarizing the changes. There’s no particular formatting requirement to this message, but it should be something that future-you is able to easily understand. For instance, the commit message from the initial draft of this document reads as:\nInitial draft of Lab 01 (STA9750)\n\n- Installing R and RStudio\n- Git and GitHub\n- Leaflet Example for Styler\n\nTODO: Fuller shell explainers\nTODO: Link more git help\nWhen I read this, I know the purpose of the change I made (first line), the contents of that change (list), and parts that still need more work.\nFinally, after you save a change, it is only saved on your computer. The true power of git comes from its ability to copy changes and backups across machines. This gives you an easy way to store backups in case your computer dies and makes collaboration efficient and fun. git allows you to push and pull changes between machines in endlessly powerful (but sometimes complex) ways. For this course, we’ll keep things simple and only use GitHub to share code. We discuss GitHub in the next section.\nReference: We will not use all of the functionality of git in this course, but you should familiarize yourself with Chapters 1, 2, and 6 of the Git Book over the next two weeks.\n\nGitHub is an industry-standard code hosting and collaboration platform. In addition to hosting copies of code, GitHub provides web hosting, bug reporting, code review, continuous integration, documentation wikis, and discussion fora. You will explore GitHub in more detail starting in Mini-Project #00.\n\n\nA major theme of this course will be sharing and co-developing code with your classmates, both for peer feedback and for the course project. Code sharing is hard! Everyone writes code a little differently and what is clear to you may not be clear at all to your reader.\nTo make code sharing just a bit easier, we use tools to ensure all code shared in this course is consistently formatted. By using consistent formatting, you reduce the cognitive load on your reader, making it easier for them to focus on the ideas of your code, not how you chose to write it.\nA major strength of R is its huge number of user-contributed packages. These are “add-ins” which provide additional functionality not available in the basic version of R. As of 2024-08-26, there are over 21 thousand packages available on CRAN, the largest official repository of R packages. Beyond all those, there are thousands more packages available on other code hosting websites like GitHub.2\nWe will use the contributed styler package to format code in this course. Run the following command to automatically download and install the styler package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"styler\")\n\n(Use the clipboard icon on the right of code snippets to automatically copy code suitable for pasting into RStudio.)\nYou should see something like this:\n\nThe styler package has been downloaded and installed on your computer, but it is not yet “active” or “open” in R. In general, you will only need to download packages once, but you will need to load them each time you want to use them.3\nOpen a R file in RStudio and copy the following (ugly) code:\n\nif(!require(\"leaflet\")) install.packages(\"leaflet\")\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")){\n    install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n   }\n library(tidyverse)\n     library(rvest)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\npAGE = read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College')\n  pAGE |&gt; html_element(\".latitude\") |&gt; html_text2() -&gt; BaruchLatitude\n  baruch_longitude &lt;- pAGE |&gt; html_element(\".longitude\") |&gt; html_text2()\n  \n    BaruchLatitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(BaruchLatitude, \n                                     \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) * (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)\n baruch_longitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) * \n                             (1/60)^(0:2), na.rm=TRUE)\n  \nleaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, zoom=17) %&gt;%\n    addPopups(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, \"Look! It's &lt;b&gt;Baruch College&lt;/b&gt;!\")\n\nYou don’t need to understand what this does just yet, but it’s hopefully clear that this is ugly code. Nothing is lined up properly, capitalization is erratic, and different coding styles are intermixed rather recklessly.\nNear the top of your RStudio pane, you will see a drop-down menu titled Addins. If you successfully installed styler above, one of the Addins choices will be “style active file.” Click this and the code will be cleaned up (a bit) resulting in something like this:\n\nif (!require(\"leaflet\")) install.packages(\"leaflet\")\nif (!require(\"tidyverse\")) {\n  install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\npAGE &lt;- read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College\")\npAGE |&gt;\n  html_element(\".latitude\") |&gt;\n  html_text2() -&gt; BaruchLatitude\nbaruch_longitude &lt;- pAGE |&gt;\n  html_element(\".longitude\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nBaruchLatitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(\n  BaruchLatitude,\n  \"[^0123456789]\"\n)[[1]]) * (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)\nbaruch_longitude &lt;- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(baruch_longitude, \"[^0123456789]\")[[1]]) *\n  (1 / 60)^(0:2), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nleaflet() %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  setView(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, zoom = 17) %&gt;%\n  addPopups(-baruch_longitude, BaruchLatitude, \"Look! It's &lt;b&gt;Baruch College&lt;/b&gt;!\")\n\nIt’s far from perfect - and we will discuss the many issues in this example throughout the course - but it’s better! At a minimum, you should make sure to run styler like this on all code you submit during this course.\nAnd now that your code is cleaned up, you should run it! The Source button in the top right corner will run all code in the open file. Running the code produces something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot too shabby! That’s an interactive, dynamic map showing the location of Baruch College obtained by parsing the Baruch Wikipedia page, getting the GPS coordinates of Baruch, downloading a map file, and locating Baruch on that map.\nChallenge: Adjust this code to show Hunter college instead of Baruch.\n\nIf you want even more feedback on writing good code, install the lintr package and use the associated RStudio add-in. Unlike styler, lintr won’t make changes automatically for you, but it will highlight much more subtle possible problems.4\n\nTo become a true “power user” of tools like R and python, you will need to become more familiar with the command line interface (CLI) and associated tools.5\nThe Software Carpentry Unix Shell Tutorial is a great introduction to shell usage. Check it out!\nNB: MacOS and Linux systems work quite similarly under the hood, as both descend from the Unix tradition. By contrast, Windows works somewhat differently. Learners whose personal machine runs Windows are encouraged to take advantage of the provided Linux-running virtual machines6 as they work through this section.\n\n\nNext week, we will use these tools to begin coding in earnest. If you’re feeling ambitious, go ahead and get started on Mini-Project #00."

R, like its predecessor the S language, is optimized for interactive, data-analytic work, in contrast with python, which is optimized for general purpose computing.\nR is a programming language and runtime; we will supplement it with RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment or, less formally, an editor. RStudio is the software where you will write the code and then the R runtime will execute it.\n\nStudents should first install R from https://cloud.r-project.org/.\n\n\nDon’t fear the 90’s web design! Click image for detailed installation instructions.\n\nAs of 2024-08-26, the most recent version of R is 4.4.1. Using the most current version of R will reduce the likelihood of issues later in the course.\n\nNext, download and install the RStudio IDE (desktop edition).\n\n\nClick image for detailed installation instructions.\n\nRStudio is highly configurable and I recommend taking advantage of all its built-in features. If you go to the Global Options menu (accessible under Tools), I recommend the following settings:\n\nGeneral: Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”.\nGeneral: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”\nCode / Editing: Set “Tab width” to 2\nCode / Editing: Check\n\n“Insert spaces for Tab”\nAuto-detect code indentation\nInsert matching parens / quotes\nUse native pipe operator\nAuto-indent code after paste\nVertically align arguments in auto-indent\nContinue comment when inserting new line\n\n\nCode / Display: Check\n\nShow line numbers\nShow margin (margin column should be 80)\n\n\nCode / Diagnostics: check all “R” diagnostics.\nAppearance: Pick a color theme you enjoy. (I’m partial to light text on a dark background)\n\nYou may wish to enable GitHub Copilot. I have little experience with GH Copilot, but it seems quite popular and is allowed in this course. It is not guaranteed to be accurate at all times - and “the AI told me to” is not a valid excuse if your code is wrong - but on balance, it should be useful.\n\nWe won’t use it this week, but you will need to install Quarto before starting on Mini-Project #00."

    "text": "git is a source-code management tool, used by developers to manage the code they write. If you’ve ever been part of a large project and struggled to coordinate all team members using the same version of a document, git exists to solve that problem.\nIn this course, we will use three main functions of git:\n\n\nstaging: telling git, I want you to prepare to save a certain file\n\ncommitting: saving a set of related changes\n\npushing: copying your committed changes to a separate server for sharing and backup\n\nWhenever you write code you are happy with, you should use git to save it. Saving changes with git is cheap and easy - so do it regularly. You always want git to have a backup of good code in case you loose power, accidentally delete a file, break something in a way you’re not sure how to undo, etc..\nRStudio comes with powerful git integration. Once you have created a project, you should see a tab labelled “Git” in the top right corner of your IDE window that looks something like this:\n\nTo stage a file - prepare to save it - click the empty check box next to the file name. A new file shows a status of “?” - this is git saying “I’ve never seen this file before. Do you want me to track it for you?”. Later, when you make further changes to file you have already asked git to track, a status of “M” (for Modified) will be shown.\nOn its own staging a file does nothing. You also need to commit it for git to truly track it.1 The Commit button will commit all staged changes. When you make a commit, git requires a brief message summarizing the changes. There’s no particular formatting requirement to this message, but it should be something that future-you is able to easily understand. For instance, the commit message from the initial draft of this document reads as:\nInitial draft of Lab 01 (STA9750)\n\n- Installing R and RStudio\n- Git and GitHub\n- Leaflet Example for Styler\n\nTODO: Fuller shell explainers\nTODO: Link more git help\nWhen I read this, I know the purpose of the change I made (first line), the contents of that change (list), and parts that still need more work.\nFinally, after you save a change, it is only saved on your computer. The true power of git comes from its ability to copy changes and backups across machines. This gives you an easy way to store backups in case your computer dies and makes collaboration efficient and fun. git allows you to push and pull changes between machines in endlessly powerful (but sometimes complex) ways. For this course, we’ll keep things simple and only use GitHub to share code. We discuss GitHub in the next section.\nReference: We will not use all of the functionality of git in this course, but you should familiarize yourself with Chapters 1, 2, and 6 of the Git Book over the next two weeks.\n\nGitHub is an industry-standard code hosting and collaboration platform. In addition to hosting copies of code, GitHub provides web hosting, bug reporting, code review, continuous integration, documentation wikis, and discussion fora. You will explore GitHub in more detail starting in Mini-Project #00."

Everyone writes code a little differently and what is clear to you may not be clear at all to your reader.\nTo make code sharing just a bit easier, we use tools to ensure all code shared in this course is consistently formatted. By using consistent formatting, you reduce the cognitive load on your reader, making it easier for them to focus on the ideas of your code, not how you chose to write it.\nA major strength of R is its huge number of user-contributed packages. These are “add-ins” which provide additional functionality not available in the basic version of R. As of 2024-08-26, there are over 21 thousand packages available on CRAN, the largest official repository of R packages. Beyond all those, there are thousands more packages available on other code hosting websites like GitHub.2\nWe will use the contributed styler package to format code in this course.

Instead of saving everything every time, there is great power in only saving “good” or “finished” changes to a large project, while leaving work-in-progress elsewhere unsaved. You probably won’t need this level of control until you get to the course project, but it’s better to have it than not.↩︎\nIf you are interested in bioinformatics, the Bioconductor project develops incredible open-source R packages.↩︎\nWhile this may feel cumbersome, it’s really not dissimilar to any other software you use (or R itself). You need to download it once, but you need to open it each time you intend to use it. There’s no harm in re-downloading–free software!–but it wastes time and bandwidth. Since we benefit so much from the free-software community, the very least we can do is not run up their internet bills unnecessarily.↩︎\nSome of the issues identified by lintr may be false positives, but the false positive rate is quite low, especially for the sort of procedural code that is the focus of this course. You should default to trying to appease lintr, but feel free to use the course discussion board for any questions.↩︎\nAs an added benefit, use of the CLI also makes you look like a 90s movie hacker to all your friends.↩︎\nSee the Course Resources page.↩︎"
