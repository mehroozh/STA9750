Roughly, this means that most weeks, students will be asked to complete a small pre-assignment each week to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week’s lecture. Each class period will be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more detail and an extended lab activity designed to build familiarity and fluency with that week’s subject matter."

(If you have done low-level work before, you might ask where the extra bit went: it’s used for encoding NA values.)\nNumeric: 64-bit (double precision) floating point values, ranging from (approximately) \\(\\pm 10^{308}\\). The detailed behavior of numeric (often called double) data is beyond this course, but it is well documented elsewhwere.\nCharacter: the topic of today’s discussion.\n\nR makes no difference between a character - in the sense of a single letter - and a string: in particular, each element of a character vector is an (arbitrary length) string. Specialized functions are required for work at the true “single letter” scale. If you come from other languages, this behavior might be surprising, but it allows R to handle much of the complexity associated with characters automagically, which greatly simplifies data analysis.\nWhen speaking, we refer to R as using strings, even if R itself calls them character elements for historical reasons."

    "title": "STA 9750 Week 12 Pre-Assignment: Strings and Things",
    "section": "Encoding",
    "text": "Encoding\nHow are strings represented on a computer? The answer has evolved over time, but the current state of the art - used by almost all non-legacy software - is based on the Unicode system and the UTF-8 encoding.\nThe Unicode system is comprised of two essential parts: - A numbered list of “letter-like” elements - Rules for manipulating those elements\nWhile this seems simple, it is anything but. The history of string representations in computers is a long and painful story of programmers repeatedly underestimating the complexity of the seemingly simple task of listing “all the letters.”\nThe Unicode consortium makes a long list of characters that computers should be able to represent: the most recent version of the Unicode standard includes 149,813 characters divided into 161 scripts. These include everything from the basic (Anglo-American) Latin alphabet to the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets to Chinese and Japanese characters to the undeciphered Linear A alphabet and Tengwar, the fictional script used in the Lord of the Rings novels. The Unicode standard also includes a wide set of Emoji (approximately 4000) and many “modifying” characters.\nTo each of these, the Unicode consortium assigns a code point : a numerical identifier. Even superficially similar characters may be assigned different code points to distinguish them: for example, “H” is code point U+0048 with the official description “Latin Capital Letter H” while “Η” is U+0397, “Greek Capital Letter Eta.”\nThe difference between these characters is essential to know how to manipulate them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the tolower function to lower-case each of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unicode standard defines the lower case mapping of U+0048 as the Latin lower case h, while the lower case mapping of U+0397 as the Greek lower case eta, which looks something like a streched n. \nIn general, these mappings are incredibly complicated and depend not only on the specific code point, but also the set of translation rules being used. (Certain languages have different lower/upper mappings for what are otherwise the same letter.)\nWhile you don’t need to know all of this complexity, it is essential to know that it’s out there and to rely on battle-tested libraries to perform these mappings.\nUnicode is supplemented by the UTF-8 encodings, which controls how 0/1-bit strings are actually translated to code points. (Fonts then map code points to what you see on the screen.) UTF-8 is more-or-less back-compatible with other major encodings, so it’s a good default. When dealing with modern websites or public data sources, they almost always present their contents in a UTF-8 compatible encoding (if not UTF-8 proper) so you should be ok.\nA well-formatted website will state its encoding near the top of the page:\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nread_html(\"https://baruch.cuny.edu\") |&gt;\n    html_elements(\"meta[charset]\") |&gt;\n    html_attr(\"charset\")\n\n[1] \"UTF-8\"\n\n\nAdvice: Whenever possible, make sure you are using UTF-8 strings: if your data is not UTF-8, reencode it to UTF-8 as soon as possible. This will save you much pain."

    "title": "STA 9750 Week 12 Pre-Assignment: Strings and Things",
    "section": "String Manipulation",
    "text": "String Manipulation\nOnce data is in R and encoded as UTF-8 Unicode points, we have several tools for dealing with strings. Your first port of call should be the stringr package.\nAll the functions of the stringr package start with str_ and take a vector of strings as the first argument, making them well suited for chained analysis.\nLet’s start with str_length which simply computes the length of each element. For the basic Latin alphabet, this more or less matches our intuition:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nx &lt;- c(\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"Baruch.\")\nstr_length(x)\n\n[1] 1 2 1 7 2 7\n\n\nbut it can be tricky for strings that involve Unicode combining characters.\n\nstr_length(\"X̅\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere the “overbar” is a combining character which we add on to the X. This is commonly (though not always) used for languages with accents (e.g. French) or for languages where vowels are written above and below the main script (Arabic or Hebrew). This same idea is used for certain Emoji constructs:\n\nstr_length(\"👨🏿\")\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nHere, “Man with Dark Skin Tone” is the combination of “Man” and “Dark Skin Tone.” (Compare how this appears in the rendered document to how RStudio prints it.)\nWhile there is complexity in all of Unicode, str_length will behave as you might expect for “regular” text. I’m going to stop showing the “scary case” of Unicode, but you should be aware of it for the remainder of these exercises.\n\nConcatenation\nYou have already seen the base paste and paste0 functions for combining two string vectors together.\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Michael\", \"Mary\", \"Gus\")\ny &lt;- c(\"Son\", \"Daughter\", \"Dog\")\n\npaste(x, y)\n\n[1] \"Michael Son\"   \"Mary Daughter\" \"Gus Dog\"      \n\n\nBy default, paste combines strings with a space between them, while paste0 omits the space. paste is typically what you want for strings for human reading, while paste0 is a better guess for computer-oriented text (e.g., putting together a URL).\nYou can change the separator by passing a sep argument to paste:\n\npaste(x, y, sep = \" is my \")\n\n[1] \"Michael is my Son\"   \"Mary is my Daughter\" \"Gus is my Dog\"      \n\n\nYou can also combine together multiple elements of a vector using the collapse argument:\n\npaste(x, collapse = \" and \")\n\n[1] \"Michael and Mary and Gus\"\n\n\n\nExercises:\nUsing the paste function, make a vector of strings like “John’s favorite color is blue”:\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\nModify your answer to write a (run-on) sentence of favorite colors: “John’s favorite color is blue and Jane’s favorite color is orange and …”\n\npeople &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Randy\", \"Tammi\")\ncolors &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"grey\", \"chartreuse\")\n\n\n\n\nSubstring Selection\nWhen cleaning up data for analysis, it is common to need to take substrings from larger text. The str_sub function will do this:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"How\", \"much\", \"is\", \"that\", \"puppy\", \"in\", \"the\", \"window?\")\nstr_sub(x, 1, 2)\n\n[1] \"Ho\" \"mu\" \"is\" \"th\" \"pu\" \"in\" \"th\" \"wi\"\n\n\nIf you want to go all the way to the end, set the end element to -1:\n\nstr_sub(x, 2, -1)\n\n[1] \"ow\"     \"uch\"    \"s\"      \"hat\"    \"uppy\"   \"n\"      \"he\"     \"indow?\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUsing str_sub, remove the system name (CUNY or UC) and return only the campus name:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nuc_schools &lt;- c(\"UC Berkeley\", \"UC San Diego\", \"UC Santa Cruz\", \"UC Davis\")\ncuny_schools &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"City College, CUNY\", \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nDetect and Matching\nOften we only need to know whether a particular substring is present in a larger string. We can use str_detect to do this:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_detect(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nThe str_match function will return the text of the match. Here it’s useless, but we’ll see that it becomes more powerful when we allow more flexible pattern specifications.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ndogs &lt;- c(\"basset hound\", \"greyhound\", \"labrador retreiver\", \"border collie\", \"Afgahn hound\")\nstr_match(dogs, \"hound\")\n\n     [,1]   \n[1,] \"hound\"\n[2,] \"hound\"\n[3,] NA     \n[4,] NA     \n[5,] \"hound\"\n\n\n\nExercises\nUse str_detect to find the CUNY schools:\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nschools &lt;- c(\"UC Davis\", \n             \"UC Santa Cruz\", \n             \"City College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC Berkeley\", \n             \"La Guardia Community College, CUNY\", \n             \"Baruch College, CUNY\", \n             \"UC San Diego\")\nstr_sub(uc_schools)\n\n[1] \"UC Berkeley\"   \"UC San Diego\"  \"UC Santa Cruz\" \"UC Davis\"     \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Patterns\nWhile working by individual characters is sometimes useful (for very regular data), we generally need more powerful tools: regular expressions (RE) provide a compact language for specifying patterns in strings. We’ll introduce the basics here to help with string functions and then explore some more advanced RE features.\nThe most basic pattern is a set of elements in brackets: this means “any of these”.\nFor example, we want to see which names have an “A” in them:\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Jane\", \"Rhonda\", \"Reggie\", \"Bernie\", \"Walter\", \"Arthur\")\nstr_detect(names, \"a\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"A\") ## Wrong!\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nstr_detect(names, \"[Aa]\") ## Right!\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nAlternatively, we can see which strings contain numbers:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"73 cows\", \"47 chickens\", \"a dozen eggs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nIf we use str_match we can pull out the matching element:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"3 soups\", \"5 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nBy default, this only finds one appearance of the pattern:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"23 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"56 fish\")\n\n# Why is this wrong?\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] \"2\" \n[2,] \"3\" \n[3,] \"5\" \n\n\nWe can modify the pattern specifier to include count information. The basic behavior is to add explicit count bounds:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"2 burgers\", \"34 soups\", \"567 fish\")\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2}\")\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] NA  \n[2,] \"34\"\n[3,] \"56\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] NA   \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,3}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\nstr_match(x, \"[0123456789]{2,}\")\n\n     [,1] \n[1,] NA   \n[2,] \"34\" \n[3,] \"567\"\n\n\nHere a single number is an exact count ({2}), while pairs ({2,3}) specify a range. If one end of the range is left empty, it is 0 or infinite (depending on the direction).\nCertain count specifications are sufficiently useful to get their own syntax:\n\nOne or more: + is equivalent to {1,}\nZero or more: * is equivalent to {0,}\nOne or zero: ? is equivalent to {0,1}.\n\nUse these specifications for the next set of exercises.\n\nExercises\nWhich strings contain a three digit number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\nstr_detect(x, \"\\\\d{3}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining patterns\nYou can combine REs to make more complex patterns:\n\n(a|b) means a or b. This is like [] notation but a, b can be more complex than single characters\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Baruch College, CUNY\", \"UC Berkeley\", \"Harvard University\")\nstr_detect(x, \"(CUNY|UC)\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n[^abc] means anything other than a, b, c. You can often achieve a similar effect using the negate argument to str_detect, but you need this specifically for str_match\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"10 blue fish\", \"three wet goats\", \"15 otters in hats\")\nstr_detect(x, \"[^0123456789]\")\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\n^ outside of a bracket denotes the start of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"rum\", \"white rum\", \"flavored rum\")\nstr_detect(x, \"^rum\")\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n$ denotes the end of a line:\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"bourbon whiskey\", \"scotch whisky\", \"whiskey liqueurs\")\nstr_detect(x, \"whisk[e]?y$\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nSee the stringr RE docs for more examples of regular expressions.\n\nExercises\n\nUse a regular expression to find which of these are fish species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a regular expression to find words with three or more vowels in a row:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the words where “q” is not followed by a “u”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacement\nThe str_replace function allows us to replace a string with something else. This is particularly useful when cleaning up text:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Manhattan, NY\", \"Bronx, New York\", \"Brooklyn, ny\", \"Queens, nY\")\nstr_replace(x, \"([nN][yY]|New York)\", \"NY\")\n\n[1] \"Manhattan, NY\" \"Bronx, NY\"     \"Brooklyn, NY\"  \"Queens, NY\""
