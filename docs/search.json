    "text": "Welcome to the course website for STA/OPR 9750 (Fall 2024)!\nSTA/OPR 9750 is an Introduction to R targeted at students in the MS in Business Analytics, MS in Statistics, and MS in Quantitative Methods programs. Though listed as a double course, STA9750 and OPR9750 will be taught and graded jointly: students are encouraged to collaborate with classmates in either section.\nThis year, STA9750 will be taught in a mixture of the flipped-classroom and experiential-learning formats. Roughly, this means that most weeks, students will be asked to complete a small pre-assignment each week to introduce the core concept(s) covered in that week’s lecture. Each class period will be split between a brief lecture covering concepts in more detail and an extended lab activity designed to build familiarity and fluency with that week’s subject matter."
