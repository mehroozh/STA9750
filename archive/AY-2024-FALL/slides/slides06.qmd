## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #01

üëè Thank you to everyone who took part in peer feedback! üëè

(Tech issues on our end...)

. . .

Also - let's thank Charles for going through every post manually with reminders üëè

## {{< var course.short >}} Mini-Project #01

Some popular tips:

-   The [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/) makes very nice tables
-   `Quarto` allows "code folding": useful for hiding long boring code blocks

```{r echo=TRUE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
1 + 1
```

You can set this globally. You also want to keep `echo: true`.
